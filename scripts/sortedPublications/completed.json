    "abstract": "Populations of the non-migratory estuarine fishFundulus heteroclitusinhabiting the heavily polluted New Bedford Harbour (NBH) estuary have shown inherited tolerance to local pollutants introduced to their habitats in the past 100 years. Here we examine two questions: (i) Is there pollution-driven selection on the mitochondrial genome across a fine geographical scale? and (ii) What is the pattern of migration among sites spanning a strong pollution gradient? Whole mitochondrial genomes were analysed for 133F. heteroclitusfrom seven nearby collection sites: four sites along the NBH pollution cline (approx. 5 km distance), which had pollution-adapted fish, as well as one site adjacent to the pollution cline and two relatively unpolluted sites about 30 km away, which had pollution-sensitive fish. Additionally, we used microsatellite analyses to quantify genetic variation over threeF. heteroclitusgenerations in both pollution-adapted and sensitive individuals collected from two sites at two different time points (1999/2000 and 2007/2008). Our results show no evidence for a selective sweep of mtDNA in the polluted sites. Moreover, mtDNA analyses revealed that both pollution-adapted and sensitive populations harbour similar levels of genetic diversity. We observed a high level of non-synonymous mutations in the most polluted site. This is probably associated with a reduction inNeand concomitant weakening of purifying selection, a demographic expansion following a pollution-related bottleneck or increased mutation rates. Our demographic analyses suggest that isolation by distance influences the distribution of mtDNA genetic variation between the pollution cline and the clean populations at broad spatial scales. At finer scales, population structure is patchy, and neither spatial distance, pollution concentration or pollution tolerance is a good predictor of mtDNA variation. Lastly, microsatellite analyses revealed stable population structure over the last decade.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe proxy record of global temperature shows that the dominant periodicity of the glacial cycle shifts from 40 kyr (obliquity) to 100 kyr (eccentricity) about a million years ago. Using climate model simulations, here we show that the pace of the glacial cycle depends on the pattern of hemispheric sea ice growth. In a cold climate the sea ice grows asymmetrically between two hemispheres under changes to Earth's orbital precession, because sea ice growth potential outside of the Arctic Circle is limited. This difference in hemispheric sea ice growth leads to an asymmetry in absorbed solar energy for the two hemispheres, particularly when eccentricity is high, even if the annual average insolation is similar. In a warmer climate, the hemispheric asymmetry of the sea ice decreases as mean Arctic and Antarctic sea ice decreases, diminishing the precession and eccentricity signals and explaining the dominant obliquity signal (40 kyr) before the mid‐Pleistocene transition.",

Here, the features of shock wave propagation are explored theoretically. The initial stage of the shock motion is simulated as a one-dimensional process. As the nonlinear wave expands to form a blast wave, a system of conservation equations, simplified to the Euler equations, is employed to model wave propagation. The Euler equations are solved numerically by the 5th order weighted essentially non-oscillatory finite difference scheme with the time integration carried out using the 3rd order total variation diminishing Runge Kutta method. The numerical results for the shock wave evolution are compared with those obtained from experiments with a meltcast 2,6-dinitrotoluene sample. The calculations lay a theoretical foundation for a recently investigated technique for photoacoustically sensing explosives using a vibrometer.",

    "abstract": "Sickle-cell anaemia (SCA) is an inherited blood disorder exhibiting heterogeneous cell morphology and abnormal rheology, especially under hypoxic conditions. By using a multiscale red blood cell (RBC) model with parameters derived from patient-specific data, we present a mesoscopic computational study of the haemodynamic and rheological characteristics of blood from SCA patients with hydroxyurea (HU) treatment (on-HU) and those without HU treatment (off-HU). We determine the shear viscosity of blood in health as well as in different states of disease. Our results suggest that treatment with HU improves or worsens the rheological characteristics of blood in SCA depending on the degree of hypoxia. However, on-HU groups always have higher levels of haematocrit-to-viscosity ratio (HVR) than off-HU groups, indicating that HU can indeed improve the oxygen transport potential of blood. Our patient-specific computational simulations suggest that the HVR level, rather than the shear viscosity of sickle RBC suspensions, may be a more reliable indicator in assessing the response to HU treatment.",

    "abstract": "In atomistic simulations, the location of the saddle point on the potential-energy surface (PES) gives important information on transitions between local minima, for example, via transition-state theory. However, the search for saddle points often involves hundreds or thousands of ab initio force calls, which are typically all done at full accuracy. This results in the vast majority of the computational effort being spent calculating the electronic structure of states not important to the researcher, and very little time performing the calculation of the saddle point state itself. In this work, we describe how machine learning (ML) can reduce the number of intermediate ab initio calculations needed to locate saddle points. Since machine-learning models can learn from, and thus mimic, atomistic simulations, the saddle-point search can be conducted rapidly in the machine-learning representation. The saddle-point prediction can then be verified by an ab initio calculation; if it is incorrect, this strategically has identified regions of the PES where the machine-learning representation has insufficient training data. When these training data are used to improve the machine-learning model, the estimates greatly improve. This approach can be systematized, and in two simple example problems we demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the number of ab initio force calls. We expect that this approach and future refinements will greatly accelerate searches for saddle points, as well as other searches on the potential energy surface, as machine-learning methods see greater adoption by the atomistics community.",

To isolate the strain effect, we have investigated the influence of externally applied elastic strain on the catalytic activity of metal films in the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). We show that elastic strain tunes the catalytic activity in a controlled and predictable way. Both theory and experiment show strain controls reactivity in a controlled manner consistent with the qualitative predictions of the HER volcano plot and the d‐band theory: Ni and Pt's activities were accelerated by compression, while Cu's activity was accelerated by tension. By isolating the elastic strain effect from the ligand effect, this study provides a greater insight into the role of elastic strain in controlling electrocatalytic activity.",

The system also produces heat maps to display the locations of numerous novel, informative leaf characters in a visually intuitive way. With assistance from computer vision, the systematic and paleobotanical value of leaves is ready to increase significantly.",

The goal of this study is to understand the provenance of the sedimentary deposits within this open‐basin lake using a source‐to‐sink approach. Two fan deposits located within the basin have distinct visible to near‐infrared mineralogic signatures measured by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM). The northern fan is spectrally characterized by a mixture of Mg‐rich carbonate and olivine, while the western fan is characterized by Fe/Mg‐smectite (e.g., saponite or nontronite) with variable amounts of Mg‐rich carbonate and olivine in isolated exposures. The watersheds of these deposits contain a variety of geomorphic units that are likely to have supplied sediment to the Jezero crater paleolake, as the fluvial valleys that fed the basin incise these units. The geomorphic units include exposures of Fe/Mg‐smectite‐, olivine‐, and Mg‐rich carbonate‐bearing terrain. We show that the difference in fan deposit mineralogy is a function of the areal exposure of the major geomorphic units within their watersheds. This indicates that the spectrally dominant aqueous alteration minerals in the fan deposits are primarily detrital, or transported, in nature and did not form in situ. We conclude that the aqueous alteration of the units in the watershed occurred prior to the fluvial activity that carved the valleys of the Jezero crater paleolake system, and that the two periods of aqueous activity are not genetically related.",

It is one of the most abundant groups of animals in the sea and the only molluscan lineage that has successfully colonized land. Yet the relationships among and within its constituent clades have remained in flux for over a century of morphological, anatomical and molecular study. Here, we re-evaluate gastropod phylogenetic relationships by collecting new transcriptome data for 40 species and analysing them in combination with publicly available genomes and transcriptomes. Our datasets include all five main gastropod clades: Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda and Heterobranchia. We use two different methods to assign orthology, subsample each of these matrices into three increasingly dense subsets, and analyse all six of these supermatrices with two different models of molecular evolution. All 12 analyses yield the same unrooted network connecting the five major gastropod lineages. This reduces deep gastropod phylogeny to three alternative rooting hypotheses. These results reject the prevalent hypothesis of gastropod phylogeny, Orthogastropoda. Our dated tree is congruent with a possible end-Permian recovery of some gastropod clades, namely Caenogastropoda and some Heterobranchia subclades.",

We hoped to resolve these issues by sequencing whole plastid genomes for representative species and combining these with molecular data previously obtained from an expanded taxon sample.• Methods: We performed paired‐end Illumina sequencing of plastid genomes of 22 Viburnum species and combined these data with a 10‐gene data set to infer phylogenetic relationships for 113 species. We used the results to devise a comprehensive phylogenetic classification and to analyze the evolution of eight morphological characters that vary among early‐branching lineages.• Key results: With greatly increased levels of confidence in most of the early branches, we propose a phylogenetic classification of Viburnum, providing formal phylogenetic definitions for 30 clades, including 13 with names recognized under the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants, eight with previously proposed informal names, and nine newly proposed names for major branches. Our parsimony reconstructions of bud structure, leaf margins, inflorescence form, ruminate endosperm, extrafloral nectaries, glandular trichomes, palisade anatomy, and pollen exine showed varying levels of homoplasy, but collectively provided morphological support for some, though not all, of the major clades.• Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the value of next‐generation plastid sequencing, the ease of creating a formal phylogenetic classification, and the utility of such a system in describing patterns of character evolution.",

Results: We tested 23 genes in development of the sea star Patiria miniata that fall into five categories: (1) Conserved germ‐line factors; (2) Genes involved in the inductive mechanism of germ‐line specification; (3) Germ‐line associated genes; (4) Molecules involved in left–right asymmetry; and (5) Genes involved in regulation and maintenance of the genome during early embryogenesis. Overall, our results support the contention that the posterior enterocoel is a source of the germ line in the sea star P. miniata. Conclusions: The germ line in this organism appears to be specified late in embryogenesis, and in a pattern more consistent with inductive interactions amongst cells. This is distinct from the mechanism seen in sea urchins, a close relative of the sea star clad. We propose that P. miniata may serve as a valuable model to study inductive mechanisms of germ‐cell specification and when compared with germ‐line formation in the sea urchin S. purpuratus may reveal developmental transitions that occur in the evolution of inherited and inductive mechanisms of germ‐line specification.

    "abstract": "The standard multilevel regressions that are widely used in neighborhood research typically ignore potential between-neighborhood correlations due to underlying spatial processes, and hence they produce inappropriate inferences about neighborhood effects. In contrast, spatial models make estimations and predictions across areas by explicitly modeling the spatial correlations among observations in different locations. A better understanding of the strengths and limitations of spatial models as compared with the standard multilevel model is needed to improve the research on neighborhood and spatial effects. This research systematically compares model estimations and predictions for binary outcomes between (distance- and lattice-based) spatial and the standard multilevel models in the presence of both within- and between-neighborhood correlations, through simulations. Results from simulation analysis reveal that the standard multilevel and spatial models produce similar estimates of fixed effects but different estimates of random effects variances. Both the standard multilevel and pure spatial models tend to overestimate the corresponding random effects variances compared with hybrid models when both nonspatial within-neighborhood and spatial between-neighborhood effects exist. Spatial models also outperform the standard multilevel model by a narrow margin in case of fully out-of-sample predictions. Distance-based spatial models provide additional spatial information and have stronger predictive power than lattice-based models under certain circumstances. These merits of spatial modeling are exhibited in an empirical analysis of the child mortality data from 1880 Newark, New Jersey.",

In the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, two Piwi proteins, Seawi and Piwi‐like1, have been identified, yet their functional contributions have not been reported. Results: Here we found that Seawi protein was localized uniformly in the early embryo and then became enriched in the primordial germ cells (PGCs) (the small micromere lineage) from blastula stage and thereafter. Morpholino knockdown of Sp‐seawi diminished PGC‐specific localization of Seawi proteins, and altered expression of other germ line markers such as Vasa and Gustavus, but had no effect on Nanos. Furthermore, Seawi knockdown transiently resulted in Vasa positive cell proliferation in the right coelomic pouch that appear to be derived from the small micromere lineage, yet they quickly disappeared with an indication of apoptosis by larval stage. Severe Seawi knockdown resulted in an increased number of apoptotic cells in the entire gut area. Conclusion: Piwi proteins appear to regulate PGC proliferation perhaps through control of Vasa accumulation. In this organism, Piwi is likely regulating mRNAs, not just transposons, and is potentially functioning both inside and outside of the germ line during embryogenesis.

Most studies, however, have been performed using centered, cropped stimuli presented on a blank background resulting in artificially low interstimulus variability. In contrast, the aim of the present study was to assess the underlying temporal dynamics of face detection presented in complex natural scenes.We recorded EEG activity while participants performed a rapid go/no-go categorization task in which they had to detect the presence of a human face. Subjects performed at ceiling (94.8% accuracy), and traditional event-related potential analyses revealed only modest modulations of the two main components classically associated with face processing (P100 and N170). A multivariate pattern analysis conducted across all EEG channels revealed that face category could, however, be readout very early, under 100 ms poststimulus onset. Decoding was linked to reaction time as early as 125 ms. Decoding accuracy did not increase monotonically; we report an increase during an initial 95–140 ms period followed by a plateau ∼140–185 ms–perhaps reflecting a transitory stabilization of the face information available–and a strong increase afterward. Further analyses conducted on individual images confirmed these phases, further suggesting that decoding accuracy may be initially driven by low-level stimulus properties. Such latencies appear to be surprisingly short given the complexity of the natural scenes and the large intraclass variability of the face stimuli used, suggesting that the visual system is highly optimized for the processing of natural scenes.",

Recently, a number of atomistic machine-learning (ML) tools have emerged that provide functional forms capable of reproducing the output of more expensive electronic-structure calculations; such ML tools are intriguing candidates for the MM calculator in QM/MM schemes. Here, we suggest that these ML potentials provide several natural advantages when employed in such a scheme. In particular, they may allow for newer, simpler QM/MM frameworks while also avoiding the need for extensive training sets to produce the ML potential. The drawbacks of employing ML potentials in QM/MM schemes are also outlined, which are primarily based on the added complexity to the algorithm of training and re-training ML models. Finally, two simple illustrative examples are provided which show the power of adding a retraining step to such “QM/ML” algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Marker-based XROMM requires software tools for: 1) correcting fluoroscope distortion; 2) calibrating X-ray cameras; 3) tracking radio-opaque markers; and 4) calculating rigid body motion. In this paper we describe and validate XMALab, a new open-source software package for marker-based XROMM (C++ source and compiled versions on Bitbucket). Most marker-based XROMM studies to date have used XrayProject in MATLAB. XrayProject can produce results with excellent accuracy and precision, but it is somewhat cumbersome to use and requires a MATLAB license. We have designed XMALab to accelerate the XROMM process and to make it more accessible to new users. Features include the four XROMM steps (listed above) in one cohesive user interface, real-time plot windows for detecting errors, and integration with an online data management system, XMAPortal. Accuracy and precision of XMALab when tracking markers in a machined object are ±0.010 and ±0.043 mm, respectively. Mean precision for nine users tracking markers in a tutorial dataset of minipig feeding was ±0.062 mm in XMALab and ±0.14 mm in XrayProject. Reproducibility of 3D point locations across nine users was tenfold greater in XMALab than in XrayProject, and six degree-of-freedom bone motions calculated with a joint coordinate system were three- to sixfold more reproducible in XMALab. XMALab is also suitable for tracking white or black markers in standard light videos with optional checkerboard calibration. We expect XMALab to increase both the quality and quantity of animal motion data available for comparative biomechanics research.",

    "abstract": "Comparative analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences has elucidated phylogenetic relationships. However, this powerful approach has not been fully exploited to address ribosome function. Here we identify stretches of evolutionarily conserved sequences, which correspond with regions of high functional importance. For this, we developed a structurally aligned database, FLORA (full-lengthorganismalrRNAalignment) to identify highly conserved nucleotide elements (CNEs) in 23S–28S rRNA from each phylogenetic domain (Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea). Universal CNEs (uCNEs) are conserved in sequence and structural position in all three domains. Those in regions known to be essential for translation validate our approach. Importantly, some uCNEs reside in areas of unknown function, thus identifying novel sequences of likely great importance. In contrast to uCNEs, domain-specific CNEs (dsCNEs) are conserved in just one phylogenetic domain. This is the first report of conserved sequence elements in rRNA that are domain-specific; they are largely a eukaryotic phenomenon. The locations of the eukaryotic dsCNEs within the structure of the ribosome suggest they may function in nascent polypeptide transit through the ribosome tunnel and in tRNA exit from the ribosome. Our findings provide insights and a resource for ribosome function studies.",

    "abstract": "Nascent strand sequencing (NS-seq) is used to discover DNA replication origins genome-wide, allowing identification of features for their specification. NS-seq depends on the ability of lambda exonuclease (λ-exo) to efficiently digest parental DNA while leaving RNA-primer protected nascent strands intact. We used genomics and biochemical approaches to determine if λ-exo digests all parental DNA sequences equally. We report that λ-exo does not efficiently digest G-quadruplex (G4) structures in a plasmid. Moreover, λ-exo digestion of nonreplicating genomic DNA (LexoG0) enriches GC-rich DNA and G4 motifs genome-wide. We used LexoG0 data to control for nascent strand–independent λ-exo biases in NS-seq and validated this approach at the rDNA locus. The λ-exo–controlled NS-seq peaks are not GC-rich, and only 35.5% overlap with 6.8% of all G4s, suggesting that G4s are not general determinants for origin specification but may play a role for a subset. Interestingly, we observed a periodic spacing of G4 motifs and nucleosomes around the peak summits, suggesting that G4s may position nucleosomes at this subset of origins. Finally, we demonstrate that use of Na+ instead of K+ in the λ-exo digestion buffer reduced the effect of G4s on λ-exo digestion and discuss ways to increase both the sensitivity and specificity of NS-seq.",

    "abstract": "The electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to fuels or chemicals is an attractive alternative to fossil- or biomass-based feedstocks. However, since the reduction typically requires protons in the reaction pathway, the evolution of H2 is a common side reaction; in practice H2 often dominates the observed products. In the current work, ways in which the selectivity between these two reactions can be understood and optimized are presented. First, it is shown that the identification and optimization of the expression of active edge sites in nanostructured Au catalysts for CO evolution results in catalysts with extremely high selectivities and mass activities at low overpotentials. Second, it is shown that the reactive state of the catalyst surface can have a strong steering effect on the selectivity. Fundamental adsorbate–adsorbate interactions drive the reactivity and selectivity across more reactive catalyst surfaces, and it is shown that in the example  cases of Cu and Mo catalysts, the interaction can have opposite qualitative trends.",

One such system is the opercular mechanism in fishes, which is thought to function like a four-bar linkage to depress the lower jaw. While anatomical and behavioral observations suggest some form of mechanical coupling, previous attempts to model the opercular mechanism as a planar four-bar have consistently produced poor model fits relative to observed kinematics. Using newly developed, open source mechanism fitting software, we fitted multiple three-dimensional (3D) four-bar models with varying DoF to in vivo kinematics in largemouth bass to test whether the opercular mechanism functions instead as a 3D four-bar with one or more DoF. We examined link position error, link rotation error and the ratio of output to input link rotation to identify a best-fit model at two different levels of variation: for each feeding strike and across all strikes from the same individual. A 3D, 3-DoF four-bar linkage was the best-fit model for the opercular mechanism, achieving link rotational errors of less than 5%. We also found that the opercular mechanism moves with multiple degrees of freedom at the level of each strike and across multiple strikes. These results suggest that active motor control may be needed to direct the force input to the mechanism by the axial muscles and achieve a particular mouth-opening trajectory. Our results also expand the versatility of four-bar models in simulating biomechanical systems and extend their utility beyond planar or single-DoF systems.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n               The current hypothesis regarding the mechanics of breathing in crocodylians is that the double-headed ribs, with both a capitulum and tuberculum, rotate about a constrained axis passing through the two articulations; moreover, this axis shifts in the caudal thoracic ribs, as the vertebral parapophysis moves from the centrum to the transverse process. Additionally, the ventral ribcage in crocodylians is thought to possess additional degrees of freedom through mobile intermediate ribs. In this study, X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology (XROMM) was used to quantify rib rotation during breathing in American alligators. Whilst costovertebral joint anatomy predicted overall patterns of motion across the ribcage (decreased bucket handle motion and increased calliper motion), there were significant deviations: anatomical axes overestimated pump handle motion and, generally, ribs in vivo rotate about all three body axes more equally than predicted. The intermediate ribs are mobile, with a high degree of rotation measured about the dorsal intracostal joints, especially in the more caudal ribs. Motion of the sternal ribs became increasingly complex caudally, owing to a combination of the movements of the vertebral and intermediate segments. As the crocodylian ribcage is sometimes used as a model for the ancestral archosaur, these results have important implications for how rib motion is reconstructed in fossil taxa, and illustrate the difficulties in reconstructing rib movement based on osteology alone.",

    "abstract": "Positioned at the intersection of the head, body and forelimb, the pectoral girdle has the potential to function in both feeding and locomotor behaviours—although the latter has been studied far more. In ray-finned fishes, the pectoral girdle attaches directly to the skull and is retracted during suction feeding, enabling the ventral body muscles to power rapid mouth expansion. However, in sharks, the pectoral girdle is displaced caudally and entirely separate from the skull (as in tetrapods), raising the question of whether it is mobile during suction feeding and contributing to suction expansion. We measured three-dimensional kinematics of the pectoral girdle in white-spotted bamboo sharks during suction feeding with X-ray reconstruction of moving morphology, and found the pectoral girdle consistently retracted about 11° by rotating caudoventrally about the dorsal scapular processes. This motion occurred mostly after peak gape, so it likely contributed more to accelerating captured prey through the oral cavity and pharynx, than to prey capture as in ray-finned fishes. Our results emphasize the multiple roles of the pectoral girdle in feeding and locomotion, both of which should be considered in studying the functional and evolutionary morphology of this structure.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               In order to realize the full potential of ion trap quantum computers, an improved understanding is required of the motional heating that trapped ions experience. Experimental studies of the temperature-, frequency-, and ion–electrode distance-dependence of the electric field noise responsible for motional heating, as well as the noise before and after ion bombardment cleaning of trap electrodes, suggest that fluctuations of adsorbate dipoles are a likely source of so-called ‘anomalous heating,’ or motional heating of the trapped ions at a rate much higher than the Johnson noise limit. Previous computational studies have investigated how the fluctuation of model adsorbate dipoles affects anomalous heating. However, the way in which specific adsorbates affect the electric field noise has not yet been examined, and an electric dipole model employed in previous studies is only accurate for a small subset of possible adsorbates. Here, we analyze the behavior of both in-plane and out-of-plane vibrational modes of twenty-one adsorbate–electrode combinations within the independent fluctuating dipole model, utilizing accurate first principles computational methods to determine the surface-induced dipole moments. We find the chemical specificity of the adsorbate can change the electric field noise by seven orders of magnitude and specifically that soft in-plane modes of weakly-adsorbed hydrocarbons produce the greatest noise and ion heating. We discuss the dynamics captured by the fluctuating dipole model, namely the adsorbate-dependent turn-on temperature and electric field noise magnitude, and also discuss the model’s failure to reproduce the measured 1/ω noise frequency scaling with a single adsorbate species. We suggest future research directions for improved, quantitatively predictive models based on extensions of the present framework to multiple interacting adsorbates.",

Yet, it suffers from a well-known over-emphasis on charge delocalization arising from self-interaction error that destabilizes localized states. Here, using the symmetric diamine N,N′-dimethylpiperazine as a model, we have experimentally determined the relative energy of a state with positive charge localized on one of the two nitrogen atoms, and a state with positive charge delocalized over both nitrogen atoms. The charge-localized state was found to be 0.33 (0.04) eV higher in energy than the charge-delocalized state. This provides an important test of theoretical approaches to electronic structure calculations. Calculations with all DFT functionals commonly used today, including hybrid functionals with exact exchange, fail to predict a stable charge-localized state. However, the application of an explicit self-interaction correction to a semi-local functional identifies both states and gives relative energy in excellent agreement with both experiment and CCSD(T) calculations.",

They also appear to be more active, with a higher metabolic rate and healthier lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic analysis reveals a gene expression signature enriched for metabolic and immune processes. The ancestral role of MYC as a regulator of ribosome biogenesis is reflected in reduced protein translation, which is inversely correlated with longevity. We also observe changes in nutrient and energy sensing pathways, including reduced serum IGF-1, increased AMPK activity, and decreased AKT, TOR and S6K activities. In contrast to observations in other longevity models, Myc+/– mice do not show improvements in stress management pathways.

Here we propose an efficient computational solution to this problem that has a simple interpretation, both as a topological partitioning of atomic configuration space and as a minimally constrained physical system. Our natural scheme smoothly extends the free energy of stable phases, without relying on extrapolation, thus enabling a formal assessment of widely used extrapolation schemes.",

We systematically study the ability of feedforward neural networks to learn to recognize a variety of visual relations and demonstrate that same–different visual relations pose a particular strain on these networks. Networks fail to learn same–different visual relations when stimulus variability makes rote memorization difficult. Further, we show that learning same–different problems becomes trivial for a feedforward network that is fed with perceptually grouped stimuli. This demonstration and the comparative success of biological vision in learning visual relations suggests that feedback mechanisms such as attention, working memory and perceptual grouping may be the key components underlying human-level abstract visual reasoning.",

A variety of illusions have been attributed to contextual processing — from orientation tilt effects to chromatic induction phenomena, but their neural underpinnings remain poorly understood. Here, we present a recurrent network model of classical and extra-classical receptive fields that is constrained by the anatomy and physiology of the visual cortex. A key feature of the model is the postulated existence of two spatially disjoint near-vs. far-extra-classical regions with complementary facilitatory and suppressive contributions to the classical receptive field. The model accounts for a variety of contextual illusions, reveals commonalities between seemingly disparate phenomena, and helps organize them into a novel taxonomy. It explains how center-surround interactions may shift from attraction to repulsion in tilt effects, and from contrast to assimilation in induction phenomena. The model further explains enhanced perceptual shifts generated by a class of patterned background stimuli that activate the two opponent extra-classical regions cooperatively. Overall, the ability of the model to account for the variety and complexity of contextual illusions provides computational evidence for a novel canonical circuit that is shared across visual modalities.",

In particular, while the location of the seizure onset area is usually invariant across seizures in an individual patient, the source of traveling (2–3 Hz) spike-and-wave discharges during seizures can either move with the slower propagating ictal wavefront or remain stationary at the seizure onset area. Furthermore, although many focal seizures terminate synchronously across brain areas, some evolve into distinct ictal clusters and terminate asynchronously. Here, we introduce a unifying perspective based on a new neural field model of epileptic seizure dynamics. Two main mechanisms, the co-existence of wave propagation in excitable media and coupled-oscillator dynamics, together with the interaction of multiple time scales, account for the reported diversity. We confirm our predictions in seizures and tractography data obtained from patients with pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. Our results contribute toward patient-specific seizure modeling.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies on the origin and properties of spatial patterns in motor cortex β-local field potential (β-LFP) oscillations have focused on planar traveling waves. However, it is unclear 1) whether β-LFP waves are limited to plane waves, or even 2) whether they are propagating waves of excito-excitatory activity, i.e., primarily traveling waves in excitable media; they could reflect, instead, reorganization in the relative phases of transient oscillations at different spatial sites. We addressed these two problems in β-LFPs recorded via microelectrode arrays implanted in three adjacent motor cortex areas of nonhuman primates during steady-state movement preparation. Our findings are fourfold: 1) β-LFP wave patterns emerged as transient events, despite stable firing rates of single neurons concurrently recorded during the same periods. 2) β-LFP waves showed a richer variety of spatial dynamics, including rotating and complex waves. 3) β-LFP wave patterns showed no characteristic wavelength, presenting instead a range of scales with global zero-lag phase synchrony as a limiting case, features surprising for purely excito-excitatory waves but consistent with waves in coupled oscillator systems. 4) Furthermore, excito-excitatory traveling waves induced by optogenetic stimulation in motor cortex showed, in contrast, a characteristic wavelength and reduced phase synchrony. Overall, β-LFP wave statistics differed from those of induced traveling waves in excitable media recorded under the same microelectrode array setup. Our findings suggest phase reorganization in neural coupled oscillators contribute significantly to the origin of transient β-LFP spatial dynamics during preparatory steady states and outline important constraints for spatially extended models of β-LFP dynamics in motor cortex.  NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY We show that a rich variety of transient β-local field potential (β-LFP) wave patterns emerge in motor cortex during preparatory steady states, despite stable neuronal firing rates. Furthermore, unlike optogenetically induced traveling waves, β-LFP waves showed no characteristic wavelength, presenting instead a range of scales with global phase synchrony as a limiting case. Overall, our statistical analyses suggest that transient phase reorganization in neural coupled oscillators, beyond purely excito-excitatory traveling waves, contribute significantly to the origin of motor cortex β-LFP wave patterns.",

    "abstract": "Determining the relationship between single-neuron spiking and transient (20 Hz) β-local field potential (β-LFP) oscillations is an important step for understanding the role of these oscillations in motor cortex. We show that whereas motor cortex firing rates and beta spiking rhythmicity remain sustained during steady-state movement preparation periods, β-LFP oscillations emerge, in contrast, as short transient events. Single-neuron mean firing rates within and outside transient β-LFP events showed no differences, and no consistent correlation was found between the beta oscillation amplitude and firing rates, as was the case for movement- and visual cue-related β-LFP suppression. Importantly, well-isolated single units featuring beta-rhythmic spiking (43%, 125/292) showed no apparent or only weak phase coupling with the transient β-LFP oscillations. Similar results were obtained for the population spiking. These findings were common in triple microelectrode array recordings from primary motor (M1), ventral (PMv), and dorsal premotor (PMd) cortices in nonhuman primates during movement preparation. Although beta spiking rhythmicity indicates strong membrane potential fluctuations in the beta band, it does not imply strong phase coupling with β-LFP oscillations. The observed dissociation points to two different sources of variation in motor cortex β-LFPs: one that impacts single-neuron spiking dynamics and another related to the generation of mesoscopic β-LFP signals. Furthermore, our findings indicate that rhythmic spiking and diverse neuronal firing rates, which encode planned actions during movement preparation, may naturally limit the ability of different neuronal populations to strongly phase-couple to a single dominant oscillation frequency, leading to the observed spiking and β-LFP dissociation.  NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY We show that whereas motor cortex spiking rates and beta (~20 Hz) spiking rhythmicity remain sustained during steady-state movement preparation periods, β-local field potential (β-LFP) oscillations emerge, in contrast, as transient events.

    "abstract": "Optogenetics is a new tool to study neuronal circuits that have been genetically modified to allow stimulation by flashes of light. We study recordings from single neurons within neural circuits under optogenetic stimulation. The data from these experiments present a statistical challenge of modeling a high‐frequency point process (neuronal spikes) while the input is another high‐frequency point process (light flashes). We further develop a generalized linear model approach to model the relationships between two point processes, employing additive point‐process response functions. The resulting model, point‐process responses for optogenetics (PRO), provides explicit nonlinear transformations to link the input point process with the output one. Such response functions may provide important and interpretable scientific insights into the properties of the biophysical process that governs neural spiking in response to optogenetic stimulation. We validate and compare the PRO model using a real dataset and simulations, and our model yields a superior area‐under‐the‐curve value as high as 93% for predicting every future spike. For our experiment on the recurrent layer V circuit in the prefrontal cortex, the PRO model provides evidence that neurons integrate their inputs in a sophisticated manner. Another use of the model is that it enables understanding how neural circuits are altered under various disease conditions and/or experimental conditions by comparing the PRO parameters.

    "abstract": "What are the neural dynamics of choice processes during reinforcement learning? Two largely separate literatures have examined dynamics of reinforcement learning (RL) as a function of experience but assuming a static choice process, or conversely, the dynamics of choice processes in decision making but based on static decision values. Here we show that human choice processes during RL are well described by a drift diffusion model (DDM) of decision making in which the learned trial-by-trial reward values are sequentially sampled, with a choice made when the value signal crosses a decision threshold. Moreover, simultaneous fMRI and EEG recordings revealed that this decision threshold is not fixed across trials but varies as a function of activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and is further modulated by trial-by-trial measures of decision conflict and activity in the dorsomedial frontal cortex (pre-SMA BOLD and mediofrontal theta in EEG). These findings provide converging multimodal evidence for a model in which decision threshold in reward-based tasks is adjusted as a function of communication from pre-SMA to STN when choices differ subtly in reward values, allowing more time to choose the statistically more rewarding option.",

However, adaptive behavior in stochastic environments requires the consideration of uncertainty to dynamically adjust the learning rate. We consider how cholinergic tonically active interneurons (TANs) may endow the striatum with such a mechanism in computational models spanning three Marr's levels of analysis. In the neural model, TANs modulate the excitability of spiny neurons, their population response to reinforcement, and hence the effective learning rate. Long TAN pauses facilitated robustness to spurious outcomes by increasing divergence in synaptic weights between neurons coding for alternative action values, whereas short TAN pauses facilitated stochastic behavior but increased responsiveness to change-points in outcome contingencies. A feedback control system allowed TAN pauses to be dynamically modulated by uncertainty across the spiny neuron population, allowing the system to self-tune and optimize performance across stochastic environments.",

    "abstract": "The collective dynamics of neural ensembles create complex spike patterns with many spatial and temporal scales. Understanding the statistical structure of these patterns can help resolve fundamental questions about neural computation and neural dynamics. Spatiotemporal conditional inference (STCI) is introduced here as a semiparametric statistical framework for investigating the nature of precise spiking patterns from collections of neurons that is robust to arbitrarily complex and nonstationary coarse spiking dynamics. The main idea is to focus statistical modeling and inference not on the full distribution of the data, but rather on families of conditional distributions of precise spiking given different types of coarse spiking. The framework is then used to develop families of hypothesis tests for probing the spatiotemporal precision of spiking patterns. Relationships among different conditional distributions are used to improve multiple hypothesis-testing adjustments and design novel Monte Carlo spike resampling algorithms. Of special note are algorithms that can locally jitter spike times while still preserving the instantaneous peristimulus time histogram or the instantaneous total spike count from a group of recorded neurons. The framework can also be used to test whether first-order maximum entropy models with possibly random and time-varying parameters can account for observed patterns of spiking. STCI provides a detailed example of the generic principle of conditional inference, which may be applicable to other areas of neurostatistical analysis.",

    "abstract": "Transitions into primary generalized epileptic seizures occur abruptly and synchronously across the brain. Their potential triggers remain unknown. We used optogenetics to causally test the hypothesis that rhythmic population bursting of excitatory neurons in a local neocortical region can rapidly trigger absence seizures. Most previous studies have been purely correlational, and it remains unclear whether epileptiform events induced by rhythmic stimulation (e.g., sensory/electrical) mimic actual spontaneous seizures, especially regarding their spatiotemporal dynamics. In this study, we used a novel combination of intracortical optogenetic stimulation and microelectrode array recordings in freely moving WAG/Rij rats, a model of absence epilepsy with a cortical focus in the somatosensory cortex (SI). We report three main findings: 1) Brief rhythmic bursting, evoked by optical stimulation of neocortical excitatory neurons at frequencies around 10 Hz, induced seizures consisting of self-sustained spike-wave discharges (SWDs) for about 10% of stimulation trials. The probability of inducing seizures was frequency-dependent, reaching a maximum at 10 Hz. 2) Local field potential power before stimulation and response amplitudes during stimulation both predicted seizure induction, demonstrating a modulatory effect of brain states and neural excitation levels. 3) Evoked responses during stimulation propagated as cortical waves, likely reaching the cortical focus, which in turn generated self-sustained SWDs after stimulation was terminated. Importantly, SWDs during induced and spontaneous seizures propagated with the same spatiotemporal dynamics. Our findings demonstrate that local rhythmic bursting of excitatory neurons in neocortex at particular frequencies, under susceptible ongoing brain states, is sufficient to trigger primary generalized seizures with stereotypical spatiotemporal dynamics.",

Here we used electroencephalography to investigate the neural dynamics indicative of such incidental latent structure. Event-related potentials over lateral prefrontal cortex, typically observed for instructed task rules, were stratified according to individual participants' constructed rule sets. Moreover, this individualized latent rule structure could be independently decoded from multielectrode pattern classification. Both neural markers were predictive of participants' ability to subsequently generalize rule structure to new contexts.

An estimate of the entrainment buoyancy flux scaling is made to best fit the LES results. The presence of Stokes drift forcing and the resulting Langmuir turbulence enhances the entrainment rate significantly under weak surface destabilizing buoyancy flux conditions, that is, weakly convective turbulence. In contrast, Langmuir turbulence effects are moderate when convective turbulence is dominant and appear to be additive rather than multiplicative to the convection-induced mixing. The parameterized unresolved velocity scale in the K-profile parameterization (KPP) is modified to adhere to the new scaling law of the entrainment buoyancy flux and account for the effects of Langmuir turbulence. This modification is targeted on common situations in a climate model where either Langmuir turbulence or convection is important and may overestimate the entrainment when both are weak. Nevertheless, the modified KPP is tested in a global climate model and generally outperforms those tested in previous studies. Improvements in the simulated mixed layer depth are found, especially in the Southern Ocean in austral summer.",

Such fast and forceful suction expansion poses a challenge, as muscle power is limited by muscle mass and the muscles in fish heads are relatively small. The largemouth bass powers expansion with its large body muscles, with negligible power produced by the head muscles (including the sternohyoideus). However, bluegill sunfish – with powerful strikes but different morphology and feeding behavior – may use a different balance of cranial and axial musculature to power feeding and different power outputs from these muscles. We estimated the power required for suction expansion in sunfish from measurements of intraoral pressure and rate of volume change, and measured muscle length and velocity. Unlike largemouth bass, the sternohyoideus did shorten to generate power, but it and other head muscles were too small to contribute more than 5–10% of peak expansion power in sunfish. We found no evidence of catapult-style power amplification. Instead, sunfish powered suction feeding by generating high power outputs (up to 438 W kg−1) from their axial muscles. These muscles shortened across the cranial half of the body as in bass, but at faster speeds that may be nearer the optimum for power production. Sunfish were able to generate strikes of the same absolute power as bass, but with 30–40% of the axial muscle mass. Thus, species may use the body and head muscles differently to meet the requirements of suction feeding, depending on their morphology and behavior.",

Here, we present a novel marker-based 3D stereoscopic imaging technique to reconstruct 3D motion of servo-controlled actuation of syringeal muscle insertions sites in vitro and focus on two muscles controlling sound pitch.

Additionally ML lengthening due to musculus syringealis ventralis (VS) shortening is intrinsically constraint at maximally 12% strain. Using these values we predict sound pitch to range from 350–800 Hz by VS modulation, corresponding well to previous observations.

The unit was episodic and high energy, with its salient features deriving from active river channels and sheet, debris-flow deposits. Landscape stability is indicated by the presence of compound paleosol horizons, containing Fe2O3 mottling in B horizons, cutans, and calcium carbonate concretions. All of these features indicate wet/dry cyclicity in subsurface horizons, likely attributable to such cyclicity in the climate. Drainage was largely to the north and to a lesser extent, the west; however, some current flow to the south and east is preserved which, in conjunction with the proximal location of marginal marine deposits, suggest the influence of tides in this setting.\n               The fossil vertebrates preserved in this part of the El Disecado Member are almost exclusively allochthonous, preserved as disarticulated isolated clasts in hydraulic equivalence in the braided fluvial system. A relatively diverse microvertebrate assemblage is preserved, the largest components of which are first, dinosaurs, and second, turtles. Non-tetrapod fossils are relatively uncommon, perhaps reflecting an absence of permanent standing water in this depositional setting.\n               Here we report a high-precision U-Pb date of 74.706 + 0.028 Ma (2σ internal uncertainty), obtained from zircons in an airfall tuff. The tuff is located low within the sequence studied; therefore, most of the sedimentology and fossils reported here are slightly younger. This date, which improves upon previously published 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, ultimately allows for comparison of these El Gallo faunas and environments with coeval ones globally.\n               Primary stable isotopic nodules associated with roots in the paleosols of the terrestrial portion of the El Disecado Member are compared with ratios from similar sources from coeval northern and eastern localities in North America. Distinctive latitudinal gradients are observed in both δ13C and δ18O, reflecting the unique southern and western, coastal geographic position of this locality. These differences are best explained by differences in the floras that populated the northern and eastern localities, relative to the southern and western floras reported here.",

The Variant Call Format (VCF) is a text file format generated during the variant calling process that contains genomic information and locations of variants in a group of sequenced samples. The current workflow for visualization of genomic variant data from VCF files requires use of a combination of existing tools. Here, we describe VIVA (VIsualization of VAriants), a command line utility and Jupyter Notebook based tool for evaluating and sharing genomic data for variant analysis and quality control of sequencing experiments from VCF files.

    "abstract": "AbstractTo generate a parsimonious gene set for understanding the mechanisms underlying complex diseases, we reasoned it was necessary to combine the curation of public literature, review of experimental databases and interpolation of pathway-associated genes. Using this strategy, we previously built the following two databases for reproductive disorders: The Database for Preterm Birth (dbPTB) and The Database for Preeclampsia (dbPEC). The completeness and accuracy of these databases is essential for supporting our understanding of these complex conditions. Given the exponential increase in biomedical literature, it is becoming increasingly difficult to manually maintain these databases. Using our curated databases as reference data sets, we implemented a machine learning-based approach to optimize article selection for manual curation. We used logistic regression, random forests and neural networks as our machine learning algorithms to classify articles. We examined features derived from abstract text, annotations and metadata that we hypothesized would best classify articles with genetically relevant content associated to the disorder of interest. Combinations of these features were used build the classifiers and the performance of these feature sets were compared to a standard ‘Bag-of-Words’. Several combinations of these genetic based feature sets outperformed ‘Bag-of-Words’ at a threshold such that 95% of the curated gene set obtained from the original manual curation of all articles were extracted from the articles classified by machine learning as ‘considered’. The performance was superior in terms of the reduction of required manual curation and two measures of the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The reduction in workload ranged from 0.814 to 0.846 for the dbPTB and 0.301 to 0.371 for the dbPEC. Additionally, a database of metadata and annotations is generated which allows for rapid query of individual features. Our results demonstrate that machine learning algorithms can identify articles with relevant data for databases of genes associated with complex diseases.",

Here, we provide the first in vivo evidence of global and local chromatin changes in human aging by analyzing cfDNA from the blood of individuals of different age groups. Our results show that nucleosome signals inferred from cfDNA are consistent with the redistribution of heterochromatin observed in cellular senescence and aging in other model systems. In addition, we detected a relative cfDNA loss at several genomic locations, such as transcription start and termination sites, 5′UTR of L1HS retrotransposons and dimeric AluY elements with age. Our results also revealed age and deteriorating health status correlate with increased enrichment of signals from cells in different tissues. In conclusion, our results show that the sequencing of circulating cfDNA from human blood plasma can be used as a noninvasive methodology to study age‐associated changes to the epigenome in vivo.",

    "abstract": "AbstractHolographic microscopy has emerged as a tool for in situ imaging of microscopic organisms and other particles in the marine environment: appealing because of the relatively larger sampling volume and simpler optical configuration compared to other imaging systems. However, its quantitative capabilities have so far remained uncertain, in part because hologram reconstruction and image recognition have required manual operation. Here, we assess the quantitative skill of our automated hologram processing pipeline (CCV Pipeline), to evaluate the size and concentration measurements of environmental and cultured assemblages of marine plankton particles, and microspheres. Over 1 million particles, ranging from 10 to 200 μm in equivalent spherical diameter, imaged by the 4‐Deep HoloSea digital inline holographic microscope (DIHM) are analyzed. These measurements were collected in parallel with a FlowCam (FC), Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB), and manual microscope identification. Once corrections for particle location and nonuniform illumination were developed and applied, the DIHM showed an underestimate in ESD of about 3% to 10%, but successfully reproduced the size spectral slope from environmental samples, and the size distribution of cultures (Dunaliella tertiolecta, Heterosigma akashiwo, and Prorocentrum micans) and microspheres. DIHM concentrations (order 1 to 1000 particles ml−1) showed a linear agreement (r2 = 0.73) with the other instruments, but individual comparisons at times had large uncertainty. Overall, we found the DIHM and the CCV Pipeline required extensive manual correction, but once corrected, provided concentration and size estimates comparable to the other imaging systems assessed in this study. Holographic cameras are mechanically simple, autonomous, can operate at very high pressures, and provide a larger sampling volume than comparable lens‐based tools. Thus, we anticipate that these characterization efforts will be rewarded with novel discovery in new oceanic environments.",

With intensifying threats from anthropogenic activities, both terrestrial biomes and climate are expected to change, and the need to understand land–atmosphere interactions will become increasingly crucial. We ran a climate model coupled with a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM) to investigate the establishment of terrestrial biomes starting from a bareground scenario and how these biomes influence the climate throughout their evolution. Vegetation reaches quasi-equilibrium after ~350 years, and the vegetation establishment results in global increases in temperature (~2.5 °C), precipitation (~5.5%) and evapotranspiration as well as declines in albedo and sea ice volumes. In high latitude regions, vegetation establishment decreases albedo, causing an increase in global temperatures as well as a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Low latitude tropical afforestation results in greater evapotranspiration and precipitation, and an initial decrease in temperatures due to evaporative cooling.",

    "abstract": "Lead-halide perovskites have attracted much attention over the past decade, while two main issues, i.e., the lead-induced toxicity and materials’ instability, limit their further practice in widespread applications. To overcome these limitations, an effective alternative is to design lead-free perovskite materials with the substitution of two divalent lead ions with a pair of monovalent and trivalent metal ions. However, fundamental physics and chemistry about how tuning material’s composition affects the crystal phase, electronic band structures, and optoelectronic properties of the material have yet to be fully understood. In this work, we conducted a series of density functional theory calculations to explore the mechanism that how various monovalent metal ions influence the crystal and electronic structures of lead-free Cs2MBiCl6 perovskites. We found that the Cs2MBiCl6 (M = Ag, Cu, and Na) perovskites preferred a cubic double perovskite phase with low carrier effective masses, while the Cs2MBiCl6 (M = K, Rb, and Cs) perovskites favored a monoclinic phase with relatively high carrier effective masses. The different crystal phase preferences were attributed to the different radii of monovalent metal cations and the orbital hybridization between the metal and Cl ions. The calculation showed that all Cs2MBiCl6 perovskites studied here exhibited indirect bandgaps. Smaller bandgap energies for the perovskites with a cubic phase were calculated than those of the monoclinic phase counterparts. Charge density difference calculation and electron localization functional analysis were also conducted and revealed that the carrier mobility can be improved via changing the characteristics of metal-halide bonds through compositional and, thus, crystal structure tuning. Our study shown here sheds light on the future design and fabrication of various lead-free perovskite materials for optoelectronic applications.",

Quantum calculations revealed two nearly degenerate isomers competing for the global minimum, both with a B3 ring coordinated with the Ir atom. The isomer with the higher EA consists of a B3 ring with a bridge‐bonded Ir atom (Cs , 2A′), and the second isomer features a tetrahedral structure (C3v , 2A1). The neutral tetrahedral structure was predicted to be considerably more stable than all other isomers. Chemical bonding analysis showed that the neutral C3v isomer involves significant covalent Ir−B bonding and weak ionic bonding with charge transfer from B3 to Ir, and can be viewed as an Ir–(η3‐B3+) complex. This study provides the first example of a boron‐to‐metal charge‐transfer complex and evidence of a π‐aromatic B3+ ring coordinated to a transition metal.",

An electron‐precise metal–boron triple bond was first observed in BiB2O− [Bi≡B−B≡O]− in which both boron atoms can be viewed as sp‐hybridized and the [B−BO]− fragment is isoelectronic to a carbyne (CR). To search for the first electron‐precise transition‐metal‐boron triple‐bond species, we have produced IrB2O− and ReB2O− and investigated them by photoelectron spectroscopy and quantum‐chemical calculations. The results allow to elucidate the structures and bonding in the two clusters. We find IrB2O− has a closed‐shell bent structure (Cs, 1A′) with BO− coordinated to an Ir≡B unit, (−OB)Ir≡B, whereas ReB2O− is linear (C∞v, 3Σ−) with an electron‐precise Re≡B triple bond, [Re≡B−B≡O]−.

Although substantial research has shown how summertime temperature distributions have changed over recent decades in the United States, less is known about how the heat index—a potentially more health-applicable metric of heat—has similarly evolved over this period. Moreover, the extent to which these distributional changes have overlapped with indicators of social vulnerability has not been established, despite the applicability of co-varying climatic and sociodemographic characteristics to heat-related health adaptations. Presented here is an analysis of trends in the median, 95th percentile, and ‘warm-tail spread’ (i.e., intra-seasonal range between the upper extreme and median) of warm-season (May-September) maximum heat index between 1979 and 2018 across the conterminous US. Using 40 years of data from the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset, it is shown that most of the US has experienced statistically significant positive trends in summertime heat, and that both the magnitude of trends and the shape of the frequency distributions of these measures vary regionally. Comparisons with data from the Social Vulnerability Index show that the most socially vulnerable counties appear to be warming faster than the least vulnerable, but that opposite patterns hold for trends in warm-tail spread. These findings may be applicable to further studies on climate change, heat adaptations, and environmental justice in the US.",

Vision can be reduced at any stage of DR by MAs, which may enlarge, rupture and leak fluid into the neural retina. Recent advances in ophthalmic imaging techniques enable reconstruction of the geometries of MAs and quantification of the corresponding haemodynamic metrics, such as shear rate and wall shear stress, but there is lack of computational models that can predict thrombus formation in individual MAs. In this study, we couple a particle model to a continuum model to simulate the platelet aggregation in MAs with different shapes. Our simulation results show that under a physiologically relevant blood flow rate, thrombosis is more pronounced in saccular-shaped MAs than fusiform-shaped MAs, in agreement with recent clinical findings. Our model predictions of the size and shape of the thrombi in MAs are consistent with experimental observations, suggesting that our model is capable of predicting the formation of thrombus for newly detected MAs. This is the first quantitative study of thrombosis in MAs through simulating platelet aggregation, and our results suggest that computational models can be used to predict initiation and development of intraluminal thrombus in MAs as well as provide insights into their role in the pathophysiology of DR.",

It is shown that the prefactor can be obtained by a partial phonon DOS calculation of the active region with a simple correction term accounting for the environment, under reasonable assumptions regarding atomic interactions. Convergence with respect to the size of the active region is investigated for different systems, as well as the reduction in computational costs when compared to full phonon DOS calculation.

We tested eight developmental stages in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, from the eight-cell stage to late in gastrulation. We used these datasets to parse out 22 major cell states of the embryo, focusing on key transition stages for cell type specification of each germ layer. Subclustering of these major embryonic domains revealed over 50 cell states with distinct transcript profiles. Furthermore, we identified the transcript profile of two cell states expressing germ cell factors, one we conclude represents the primordial germ cells and the other state is transiently present during gastrulation. We hypothesize that these cells of the Veg2 tier of the early embryo represent a lineage that converts to the germ line when the primordial germ cells are deleted.

    "abstract": "AbstractNanotwinned materials have been widely studied as a promising class of nanostructured materials that exhibit an exceptional combination of high strength, good ductility, large fracture toughness, remarkable fatigue resistance, and creep stability. Recently, an apparent controversy has emerged with respect to how the strength of nanotwinned materials varies as the twin thickness is reduced. While a transition from hardening to softening was observed in nanotwinned Cu when the twin thickness is reduced below a critical value, continuous hardening was reported in nanotwinned ceramics and nanotwinned diamond. Here, by conducting atomistic simulations and developing a theoretical modeling of nanotwinned Pd and Cu systems, we discovered that there exists a softening temperature, below which the material hardens continuously as the twin thickness is reduced (as in nanotwinned ceramics and diamond), while above which the strength first increases and then decreases, exhibiting a maximum strength and a hardening to softening transition at a critical twin thickness (as in nanotwinned Cu). This important phenomenon has been attributed to a transition from source- to stress-controlled plasticity below the softening temperature, and suggests that different hardening behaviors may exist even in the same nanotwinned material depending on the temperature and that at a given temperature, different materials could exhibit different hardening behaviors depending on their softening temperature.",

    "abstract": "The focus of this article is on the parallel scalability of a distributed multigrid framework, known as the DTU Compute GPUlab Library, for execution on graphics processing unit (GPU)-accelerated supercomputers. We demonstrate near-ideal weak scalability for a high-order fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) time domain model on the Oak Ridge Titan supercomputer, which is equipped with a large number of many-core CPU-GPU nodes. The high-order finite difference scheme for the solver is implemented to expose data locality and scalability, and the linear Laplace solver is based on an iterative multilevel preconditioned defect correction method designed for high-throughput processing and massive parallelism. In this work, the FNPF discretization is based on a multi-block discretization that allows for large-scale simulations. In this setup, each grid block is based on a logically structured mesh with support for curvilinear representation of horizontal block boundaries to allow for an accurate representation of geometric features such as surface-piercing bottom-mounted structures—for example, mono-pile foundations as demonstrated. Unprecedented performance and scalability results are presented for a system of equations that is historically known as being too expensive to solve in practical applications. A novel feature of the potential flow model is demonstrated, being that a modest number of multigrid restrictions is sufficient for fast convergence, improving overall parallel scalability as the coarse grid problem diminishes. In the numerical benchmarks presented, we demonstrate using 8192 modern Nvidia GPUs enabling large-scale and high-resolution nonlinear marine hydrodynamics applications.",

Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (EGME) is a testicular toxicant with well-described effects on histopathology and sperm parameters. To compare the predictivity and sensitivity of molecular biomarkers of testicular toxicity to the traditional endpoints, small RNAs in the sperm were analyzed by next generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Adult rats were exposed to 0, 50, 60, or 75 mg/kg EGME by oral gavage for 5 consecutive days. Testis histology, epididymal sperm motility, and sperm small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), mRNA fragments, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), and tRNA fragments (tRFs), were analyzed 5 weeks after cessation of exposure. Testicular histology showed a significant dose-dependent increase in retained spermatid heads (RSH), while sperm motility declined with increasing dose. RNA-sequencing of sperm small RNAs was used to identify significant dose-dependent changes in percent mRNA fragments (of total reads), percent miRNAs (of total reads), average tRF length, average piRNA length, and piRNA and tRF length-distributions. Discriminant analysis showed relatively low predictivity of exposure based on RSH or motility compared to the average read length of all assigned RNAs. Benchmark dose (BMD) modeling resulted in a BMD of 62 mg/kg using RSH, whereas average read length of all assigned RNAs resulted in a BMD of 47 mg/kg. These results showed that sperm small RNAs are sensitive and predictive biomarkers of EGME-induced male reproductive toxicity.",

Here, our objective was to develop a binary decoder to detect task engagement in humans during two distinct, conflict-based behavioral tasks. Effortful, goal-directed decision-making requires the coordinated action of multiple cognitive processes, including attention, working memory and action selection. That type of mental effort is often dysfunctional in mental disorders, e.g. when a patient attempts to overcome a depression or anxiety-driven habit but feels unable. If the onset of engagement in this type of focused mental activity could be reliably detected, decisional function might be augmented, e.g. through neurostimulation. However, there are no known algorithms for detecting task engagement with rapid time resolution. Approach. We defined a new network measure, fixed canonical correlation (FCCA), specifically suited for neural decoding applications. We extracted FCCA features from local field potential recordings in human volunteers to give a temporally continuous estimate of mental effort, defined by engagement in experimental conflict tasks. Main results. Using a small number of features per participant, we accurately decoded and distinguished task engagement from other mental activities. Further, the decoder distinguished between engagement in two different conflict-based tasks within seconds of their onset. Significance. These results demonstrate that network-level brain activity can detect specific types of mental efforts. This could form the basis of a responsive intervention strategy for decision-making deficits.",

Identifying neural activity biomarkers of brain disease is essential to provide objective estimates of disease burden, obtain reliable feedback regarding therapeutic efficacy, and potentially to serve as a source of control for closed-loop neuromodulation. In Parkinson’s disease (PD), microelectrode recordings (MER) are routinely performed in the basal ganglia to guide electrode implantation for deep brain stimulation (DBS). While pathologically-excessive oscillatory activity has been observed and linked to PD motor dysfunction broadly, the extent to which these signals provide quantitative information about disease expression and fluctuations, particularly at short timescales, is unknown. Furthermore, the degree to which informative signal features are similar or different across patients has not been rigorously investigated. We sought to determine the extent to which motor error in PD across patients can be decoded on a rapid timescale using spectral features of neural activity. Approach. Here, we recorded neural activity from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of subjects with PD undergoing awake DBS surgery while they performed an objective, continuous behavioral assessment that synthesized heterogenous PD motor manifestations to generate a scalar measure of motor dysfunction at short timescales. We then leveraged natural motor performance variations as a ‘ground truth’ to identify corresponding neurophysiological biomarkers. Main results. Support vector machines using multi-spectral decoding of neural signals from the STN succeeded in tracking the degree of motor impairment at short timescales (as short as one second). Spectral power across a wide range of frequencies, beyond the classic ‘β’ oscillations, contributed to this decoding, and multi-spectral models consistently outperformed those generated using more isolated frequency bands. While generalized decoding models derived across subjects were able to estimate motor impairment, patient-specific models typically performed better. Significance. These results demonstrate that quantitative information about short-timescale PD motor dysfunction is available in STN neural activity, distributed across various patient-specific spectral components, such that an individualized approach will be critical to fully harness this information for optimal disease tracking and closed-loop neuromodulation.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWeather and climate have substantial effects on human health. While much is known about how morbidity and mortality are affected by moderate‐to‐extreme heat, poor air quality, and heavy precipitation individually, less is known about the cumulative occurrence of these climatic hazards, and the extent to which they spatially overlap with community‐scale vulnerabilities. Specifically, there is interest in determining whether individuals living in places with the highest exposure to multiple health hazardous climatic conditions are also more vulnerable to having negative health outcomes. Presented here is a spatial analysis of the distribution of health‐relevant climatic hazards and social vulnerabilities across the New England region of the northeastern United States. We show that the frequency of excessive heat days, heavy precipitation days, and ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exceedances during the warm seasons (May–September) from 2009 to 2014 have distinct spatial distributions and are statistically significantly correlated across space with indicators of social vulnerability. We further quantify an integrated measure of the hazards and vulnerabilities to illustrate the spatial heterogeneity of overall risk, as well as to demonstrate how the choice of spatial scale influences the identification of high‐risk areas. These methods are transferrable to other locations and contexts, which could be of utility not only to geographers and epidemiologists, but also to policymakers tasked with allocating public health resources to populations at greatest risk of weather‐ and climate‐related health effects.",

Previous work has shown that\n            Mpi\n            allozyme genotypes (fast and slow) have different frequencies across Atlantic intertidal zones due to selection on postsettlement survival (i.e., allele zonation).

We show that the slow allozyme contains a derived charge-altering amino acid polymorphism, and both allozyme classes correspond to two haplogroups with multiple internal haplotypes. The locus shows several footprints of balancing selection around the fast/slow site: an enrichment of positive Tajima’s D for nonsynonymous mutations, an excess of polymorphism, and a spike in the levels of silent polymorphism relative to silent divergence, as well as a site frequency spectrum enriched for midfrequency mutations. We observe other departures from neutrality across the locus in both coding and noncoding regions. These include a nonsynonymous trans-species polymorphism and a recent mutation under selection within the fast haplogroup. The latter suggests ongoing allelic replacement of functionally relevant amino acid variants. Moreover, predicted models of\n            Mpi\n            protein structure provide insight into the functional significance of the putatively selected amino acid polymorphisms.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT\n               Cosmic Dawn (CD), when the first stars and proto-galaxies began to form, is commonly expected to be accompanied by an absorption signature at radio frequencies. This feature arises as Lyman α photons emitted by these first luminous objects couple the 21 cm excitation temperature of intergalactic hydrogen gas to its kinetic temperature, driving it into absorption relative to the cosmic microwave background. The detailed properties of this absorption profile encode powerful information about the physics of CD. Recently, Bowman et al. analysed data from the EDGES low-band radio antenna and found an unexpectedly deep absorption profile centred at 78 MHz, which could be a detection of this signature. Their specific analysis fit their measurements using a polynomial foreground model, a flattened Gaussian absorption profile, and a white noise model; we argue that a more accurate model, that includes a detailed noise model and accounting for the effects of plausible calibration errors, is essential for describing the EDGES data set. We perform a Bayesian evidence-based comparison of models of the EDGES low-band data set and find that those incorporating these additional components are decisively preferred. The subset of the best-fitting models of the data that include a global signal favours an amplitude consistent with standard cosmological assumptions (A &amp;lt; 209 mK). However, there is not strong evidence to favour models of the data including a global 21 cm signal over those without one. Ultimately, we find that the derivation of robust constraints on astrophysics from the data is limited by the presence of systematics.",

Boundary conditions at fluid-solid interface require continuity of the normal component of particle velocity and traction, whereas the tangential components vanish. A main challenge is to model interface waves, namely, the Scholte and leaky Rayleigh waves. This study uses a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (dG) finite-element method with the medium discretized using an unstructured uniform triangular meshes. The natural boundary conditions in the dG method are implemented by (1) using an explicit upwind numerical flux and (2) by using an implicit penalty flux and setting the modulus of rigidity of the acoustic medium to zero. The accuracy of these methods is evaluated by comparing the numerical solutions with analytical ones, with source and receiver at and away from the interface. The study shows that the solutions obtained from the explicit and implicit boundary conditions provide the correct results. The stability of the dG scheme is determined by the numerical flux, which also implements the boundary conditions by unifying the numerical solution at shared edges of the elements in an energy stable manner.",

    "abstract": "An essential human skill is our capacity to monitor and execute a sequence of tasks in the service of an overarching goal. Such a sequence can be as mundane as making a cup of coffee or as complex as flying a fighter plane. Previously, we showed that, during sequential control, the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits activation that ramps steadily through the sequence and is necessary for sequential task execution using fMRI in humans (Desrochers et al., 2015). It remains unknown what computations may underlie this ramping dynamic. Across two independent fMRI experiments, we manipulated three features that were unique to the sequential control task to determine whether and how they modulated ramping activity in the RLPFC: (1) sequence position uncertainty, (2) sequential monitoring without external position cues (i.e., from memory), and (3) sequential monitoring without multilevel decision making (i.e., task execution). We replicated the ramping activation in RLPFC and found it to be remarkably robust regardless of the level of task abstraction or engagement of memory functions. Therefore, these results both replicate and extend previous findings regarding the function of the RLPFC. They suggest that sequential control processes are integral to the dynamics of RLPFC activity. Advancing knowledge of the neural bases of sequential control is crucial for our understanding of the sequential processes that are necessary for daily living.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe perform sequences of tasks every day, but little is known about how they are controlled in the brain. Previously we found that ramping activity in the rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) was necessary to perform a sequence of tasks. We designed two independent fMRI experiments in human participants to determine which features of the previous sequential task potentially engaged ramping in the RLPFC. We found that any demand to monitor a sequence of state transitions consistently elicited ramping in the RLPFC, regardless of the level of the decisions made at each step in the sequence or engagement of memory functions.

Past research...Emerging large-scale biobanks pairing genotype data with phenotype data present new opportunities to prioritize shared genetic associations across multiple phenotypes for molecular validation. Past research, by our group and others, has shown gene-level tests of association produce biologically interpretable characterization of the genetic architecture of a given phenotype. Here, we present a new method, Ward clustering to identify Internal Node branch length outliers using Gene Scores (WINGS), for identifying shared genetic architecture among multiple phenotypes. The objective of WINGS is to identify groups of phenotypes, or “clusters,” sharing a core set of genes enriched for mutations in cases. We validate WINGS using extensive simulation studies and then combine gene-level association tests with WINGS to identify shared genetic architecture among 81 case-control and seven quantitative phenotypes in 349,468 European-ancestry individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify eight prioritized phenotype clusters and recover multiple published gene-level associations within prioritized clusters.",

De novo missense and protein-truncating variants from exome sequencing studies have directly implicated MBD5 in the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, little is known concerning the specific function(s) of MBD5.\n              \n                Methods\n                To gain insight into the complex interactions associated with alteration of MBD5 in individuals with ASD and related NDDs, we explored the transcriptional landscape of MBD5 haploinsufficiency across multiple mouse brain regions of a heterozygous hypomorphic Mbd5+/GT mouse model, and compared these results to CRISPR-mediated mutations of MBD5 in human iPSC-derived neuronal models.\n              \n                Results\n                Gene expression analyses across three brain regions from Mbd5+/GT mice showed subtle transcriptional changes, with cortex displaying the most widespread changes following Mbd5 reduction, indicating context-dependent effects.

However, bright foreground emission presents a significant impediment to its unbiased recovery from interferometric data. We estimate the power spectrum within a Bayesian framework and demonstrate that incorporating a priori knowledge of the spectral structure of foregrounds in the large spectral scale component of the data model enables significantly improved modelling of the foregrounds without increasing the model complexity. We explore two astrophysically motivated parametrizations of the large spectral scale model: (i) a constant plus power-law model of the form $q_{0}+q_{1}(\\nu /\\nu _{0})^{b_{1}}$ for two values of b1: b1 = 〈β〉GDSE and b1 = 〈β〉EGS, the mean spectral indices of the Galactic diffuse synchrotron emission and extragalactic source foreground emission, respectively; and (ii) a constant plus double power-law model of the form $q_{0}+q_{1}(\\nu /\\nu _{0})^{b_{1}}+q_{2}(\\nu /\\nu _{0})^{b_{2}}$ with b1 = 〈β〉GDSE and b2 = 〈β〉EGS. We estimate the EoR power spectrum from simulated interferometric data consisting of an EoR signal, Galactic diffuse synchrotron emission, extragalactic sources, and diffuse free–free emission from the Galaxy. We show that, by jointly estimating a model of the EoR signal with the constant plus double power-law parametrization of the large spectral scale model, unbiased estimates of the EoR power spectrum are recoverable on all spatial scales accessible in the data set, including on the large spatial scales that were found to be contaminated in earlier work.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYSp receiver functions have been widely used to detect the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB) and other mantle discontinuities. However, traditional common conversion point (CCP) stacking can be biased by the assumption of horizontal layers and this method typically underestimates scattering amplitudes from velocity boundaries with significant dips. A new pre-stack migration method based on recently developed Sp scattering kernels offers an alternative that more accurately captures the timing and amplitude of scattering. When calculating kernels, Sp-S times are estimated with the fast-marching method, and scattering amplitude versus direction, geometrical spreading and phase shifts are accounted for. To minimize imaging artefacts with larger station spacing, Sp receiver functions are interpolated to more closely spaced pseudo-stations using either compressive sampling or spatial averaging algorithms. To test the kernel-based stacking method, synthetic Sp phases were predicted using SPECFEM2D for velocity models with a flat Moho and a negative mantle velocity gradient with a ramp structure. The kernel-based stacking method resolves horizontal interfaces equally well as CCP stacking and outperforms CCP stacking when imaging boundaries with dips of more than 8°, although dip resolution is still limited. Use of more vertically incident phases such as SKSp improves retrieval of dipping discontinuity segments. A second approach is to down-weight the portions of the kernels that have the greatest positive interference among neighbouring stations, thus enhancing scattering from dipping structures where positive interference is lower. With this downweighting, the kernel-based stacking method applied to Sp data is able to continuously resolve LAB discontinuities with dips up to 15° and to partially resolve continuous LAB discontinuities with dips of ∼20°. The intrinsic properties of teleseismic Sp phase kernels limit their ability to resolve LAB structures with dips of ∼20–35°, but still larger dips of ∼40–50° are resolvable with dense and appropriately placed stations. Analysis of Sp scattering kernels also explains the effectiveness of CCP stacking for quasi-horizontal interfaces.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn this study we develop a new parameterization for turbulent mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer (OSBL), including the effect of Langmuir turbulence. This new parameterization builds on a recent study (Reichl and Hallberg 2018, hereafter RH18), which predicts the available energy for turbulent mixing against stable stratification driven by shear and convective turbulence. To investigate the role of Langmuir turbulence in the framework of RH18, we utilize data from a suite of previously published large-eddy simulation (LES) experiments (Li and Fox-Kemper 2017, hereafter LF17) with and without Langmuir turbulence under different idealized forcing conditions. We find that the parameterization of RH18 is able to reproduce the mixing simulated by the LES in the non-Langmuir cases, but not the Langmuir cases. We therefore investigate the enhancement of the integrated vertical buoyancy flux within the entrainment layer in the presence of Langmuir turbulence using the LES data. An additional factor is introduced in the RH18 framework to capture the enhanced mixing due to Langmuir turbulence. This additional factor depends on the surface-layer averaged Langmuir number with a reduction in the presence of destabilizing surface buoyancy fluxes. It is demonstrated that including this factor within the RH18 OSBL turbulent mixing parameterization framework captures the simulated effect of Langmuir turbulence in the LES, which can be used for simulating the effect of Langmuir turbulence in climate simulations. This new parameterization is compared to the KPP-based Langmuir entrainment parameterization introduced by LF17, and differences are explored in detail.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been one of the most extensively studied molecules in ecological, evolutionary and clinical genetics. In its early application in evolutionary genetics, mtDNA was assumed to be a selectively neutral marker conferring negligible fitness consequences for its host. However, this dogma has been overturned in recent years due to now extensive evidence for non-neutral evolutionary dynamics. Since mtDNA proteins physically interact with nuclear proteins to provide the mitochondrial machinery for aerobic ATP production, among other cell functions, co-variation of the respective genes is predicted to affect organismal fitness. To test this hypothesis we used an mtDNA-nuclear DNA introgression model in Drosophila melanogaster to test the fitness of genotypes in perturbation-reperturbation population cages and in a non-competitive assay for female fecundity. Genotypes consisted of both conspecific and heterospecific mtDNA-nDNA constructs, with either D. melanogaster or D. simulans mtDNAs on two alternative D. melanogaster nuclear backgrounds, to investigate mitonuclear genetic interactions (G x G effects). We found considerable variation between nuclear genetic backgrounds on the selection of mtDNA haplotypes. In addition, there was variation in the selection on mtDNAs pre- and post- reperturbation, demonstrating overall poor repeatability of selection. There was a strong influence of nuclear background on non-competitive fecundity across all the mtDNA species types. In only one of the four cage types did we see a significant fecundity effect between genotypes that could help explain the respective change in genotype frequency over generational time. We discuss these results in the context of G x G interactions and the possible influence of stochastic environments on mtDNA-nDNA selection.",

Although membrane-disrupting agents can kill persister cells, their therapeutic potential has been mostly overlooked because of low selectivity for bacterial versus mammalian membranes.

The selectivity of bithionol results from the presence of cholesterol in mammalian but not in bacterial membranes. We also show that the antipersister potency of membrane-active antimicrobial agents correlates with their ability to increase membrane fluidity. Our results significantly enhance our understanding of bacterial membrane disruption and membrane selectivity.",

Computations were performed using automated ab initio molecular dynamics techniques. High temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction on laser heated aerodynamically levitated samples provided experimental data on volume change during tetragonal-to-cubic phase transformation (0.55 ± 0.09% for ZrO2 and 0.87 ± 0.08% for HfO2), density and thermal expansion. Fusion enthalpies were measured using drop and catch calorimetry on laser heated levitated samples as 55 ± 7 kJ/mol for ZrO2 and 61 ± 10 kJ/mol for HfO2, compared with 54 ± 2 and 52 ± 2 kJ/mol from computation. Volumetric thermal expansion for cubic ZrO2 and HfO2 are similar and reach (4 ± 1)·10−5/K from experiment and (5 ± 1)·10−5/K from computation. An agreement with experiment renders confidence in values obtained exclusively from computation: namely heat capacity of cubic HfO2 and ZrO2, volume change on melting, and thermal expansion of the liquid to 3127 °C. Computed oxygen diffusion coefficients indicate that above 2400 °C pure ZrO2 is an excellent oxygen conductor, perhaps even better than YSZ.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMitochondrial function requires the coordinated expression of dozens of gene products from the mitochondrial genome and hundreds from the nuclear genomes. The systems that emerge from these interactions convert the food we eat and the oxygen we breathe into energy for life, while regulating a wide range of other cellular processes. These facts beg the question of whether the gene‐by‐gene interactions (G x G) that enable mitochondrial function are distinct from the gene‐by‐environment interactions (G x E) that fuel mitochondrial activity. We examine this question using a Drosophila model of mitonuclear interactions in which experimental combinations of mtDNA and nuclear chromosomes generate pairs of mitonuclear genotypes to test for epistatic interactions (G x G). These mitonuclear genotypes are then exposed to altered dietary or oxygen environments to test for G x E interactions. We use development time to assess dietary effects, and genome wide RNAseq analyses to assess hypoxic effects on transcription, which can be partitioned in to mito, nuclear, and environmental (G x G x E) contributions to these complex traits. We find that mitonuclear epistasis is universal, and that dietary and hypoxic treatments alter the epistatic interactions. We further show that the transcriptional response to alternative mitonuclear interactions has significant overlap with the transcriptional response to alternative oxygen environments. Gene coexpression analyses suggest that these shared genes are more central in networks of gene interactions, implying some functional overlap between epistasis and genotype by environment interactions. These results are discussed in the context of evolutionary fitness, the genetic basis of complex traits, and the challenge of achieving precision in personalized medicine. © 2018 The Authors.

First the theoretical failure criteria are evaluated and then the theoretical failure modes transition is evaluated. Both are found to perform extremely well. The overall failure theory contains three modes of failure, the two already mentioned plus a fracture criterion. A general conclusion from the work is that the voids nucleation criterion is of unusually broad relevance. Voids nucleation leads to voids growth and then further deteriorating mechanisms and ultimately failure. But the voids nucleation is the precipitating event of all that subsequently occurs in this process. Access to these capabilities is gained through the failure theory for all homogeneous, full density, isotropic materials. Only two standard testing measurements are needed to calibrate the entire failure theory, including the transitions.",

Here, we used phylogenetic approaches to address the causes of richness patterns among global marine regions, comparing the relative importance of colonization time, number of colonization events, and diversification rates (speciation minus extinction). We estimated regional richness using distributional data for almost all percomorph fishes (17 435 species total, including approximately 72% of all marine fishes and approximately 33% of all freshwater fishes). The high diversity of the Central Indo-Pacific was explained by its colonization by many lineages 5.3–34 million years ago. These relatively old colonizations allowed more time for richness to build up through\n            in situ\n            diversification compared to other warm-marine regions. Surprisingly, diversification rates were decoupled from marine richness patterns, with clades in low-richness cold-marine habitats having the highest rates. Unlike marine richness, freshwater diversity was largely derived from a few ancient colonizations, coupled with high diversification rates. Our results are congruent with the geological history of the marine tropics, and thus may apply to many other organisms. Beyond marine biogeography, we add to the growing number of cases where colonization and time-for-speciation explain large-scale richness patterns instead of diversification rates.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Interferometric arrays seeking to measure the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EOR) must contend with overwhelmingly bright emission from foreground sources. Accurate recovery of the 21 cm signal will require precise calibration of the array, and several new avenues for calibration have been pursued in recent years, including methods using redundancy in the antenna configuration. The newly upgraded Phase II of Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) is the first interferometer that has large numbers of redundant baselines while retaining good instantaneous UV coverage. This array therefore provides a unique opportunity to compare redundant calibration with sky-model-based algorithms. In this paper, we present the first results from comparing both calibration approaches with MWA Phase II observations. For redundant calibration, we use the package OMNICAL and produce sky-based calibration solutions with the analysis package Fast Holographic Deconvolution (FHD). There are three principal results: (1) We report the success of OMNICAL on observations of ORBComm satellites, showing substantial agreement between redundant visibility measurements after calibration. (2) We directly compare OMNICAL calibration solutions with those from FHD and demonstrate that these two different calibration schemes give extremely similar results. (3) We explore improved calibration by combining OMNICAL and FHD. We evaluate these combined methods using power spectrum techniques developed for EOR analysis and find evidence for marginal improvements mitigating artifacts in the power spectrum. These results are likely limited by the signal-to-noise ratio in the 6 hr of data used, but they suggest future directions for combining these two calibration schemes.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Observations of the 21 cm Epoch of Reionization signal are dominated by Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. The need for foreground removal has led to the development of two main techniques, often referred to as “foreground avoidance” and “foreground subtraction.” Avoidance is associated with filtering foregrounds in Fourier space, while subtraction uses an explicit foreground model that is removed. Using 1088 hr of data from the 64-element PAPER array, we demonstrate that subtraction of a foreground model prior to delay-space foreground filtering results in a modest but measurable improvement of the performance of the filter. This proof-of-concept result shows that improvement stems from the reduced dynamic range requirements needed for the foreground filter: subtraction of a foreground model reduces the total foreground power, so for a fixed dynamic range, the filter can push toward fainter limits. We also find that the choice of window function used in the foreground filter can have an appreciable affect on the performance near the edges of the observing band. We demonstrate these effects using a smaller 3 hr sampling of data from the MWA, and find that the hybrid filtering and subtraction removal approach provides similar improvements across the band as seen in the case with PAPER-64.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAortic dissection is a pathology that manifests due to microstructural defects in the aortic wall. Blood enters the damaged wall through an intimal tear, thereby creating a so-called false lumen and exposing the blood to thrombogenic intramural constituents such as collagen. The natural history of this acute vascular injury thus depends, in part, on thrombus formation, maturation, and possible healing within the false lumen. A key question is: Why do some false lumens thrombose completely while others thrombose partially or little at all? An ability to predict the location and extent of thrombus in subjects with dissection could contribute significantly to clinical decision-making, including interventional design. We develop, for the first time, a data-driven particle-continuum model for thrombus formation in a murine model of aortic dissection. In the proposed model, we simulate a final-value problem in lieu of the original initial-value problem with significantly fewer particles that may grow in size upon activation, thus representing the local concentration of blood-borne species. Numerical results confirm that geometry and local hemodynamics play significant roles in the acute progression of thrombus. Despite geometrical differences between murine and human dissections, mouse models can provide considerable insight and have gained popularity owing to their reproducibility. Our results for three classes of geometrically different false lumens show that thrombus forms and extends to a greater extent in regions with lower bulk shear rates. Dense thrombi are less likely to form in high-shear zones and in the presence of strong vortices. The present data-driven study suggests that the proposed model is robust and can be employed to assess thrombus formation in human aortic dissections.",

Two bismuth boron cluster anions, BiB2O− and Bi2B−, containing triple and double B−Bi bonds are presented. The BiB2O− and Bi2B− clusters are produced by laser vaporization of a mixed B/Bi target and characterized by photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio calculations. Well‐resolved photoelectron spectra are obtained and interpreted with the help of ab initio calculations, which show that both species are linear. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that Bi forms triple and double bonds with boron in BiB2O− ([Bi≡B−B≡O]−) and Bi2B− ([Bi=B=Bi]−), respectively. The Bi−B double and triple bond strengths are calculated to be 3.21 and 4.70 eV, respectively. This is the first experimental observation of Bi−B double and triple bonds, opening the door to design main‐group metal–boron complexes with multiple bonding.",

Upwelling of ilmenite‐bearing cumulates (IBCs) after the overturn has a dominant influence on the dynamics and long‐term thermal evolution of the lunar mantle. An important parameter determining the stability and convective behavior of the IBC is its viscosity, which was recently constrained through rock deformation experiments. To examine the effect of IBC viscosity on the upwelling of overturned lunar cumulate mantle, here we conduct three‐dimensional mantle convection models with an evolving core superposed by an IBC‐rich layer, which resulted from mantle overturn after magma ocean solidification. Our modeling shows that a reduction of mantle viscosity by 1 order of magnitude, due to the presence of ilmenite, can dramatically change convective planform and long‐term lunar mantle evolution. Our model results suggest a relatively stable partially molten IBC layer that has surrounded the lunar core to the present day.",

    "abstract": "The coding sequence of each human pre-mRNA is interrupted, on average, by 11 introns that must be spliced out for proper gene expression. Each intron contains three obligate signals: a 5′ splice site, a branch site, and a 3′ splice site. Splice site usage has been mapped exhaustively across different species, cell types, and cellular states. In contrast, only a small fraction of branch sites have been identified even once. The few reported annotations of branch site are imprecise as reverse transcriptase skips several nucleotides while traversing a 2–5 linkage. Here, we report large-scale mapping of the branchpoints from deep sequencing data in three different species and in the SF3B1 K700E oncogenic mutant background. We have developed a novel method whereby raw lariat reads are refined by U2snRNP/pre-mRNA base-pairing models to return the largest current data set of branchpoint sequences with quality metrics. This analysis discovers novel modes of U2snRNA:pre-mRNA base-pairing conserved in yeast and provides insight into the biogenesis of intron circles. Finally, matching branch site usage with isoform selection across the extensive panel of ENCODE RNA-seq data sets offers insight into the mechanisms by which branchpoint usage drives alternative splicing.",

However, very few microbiome studies focus on animals that inhabit the intertidal. In this study, we investigate the microbiome of the intertidal barnacle Semibalanus balanoides. We first describe the microbiome of two body tissues: the feeding appendages, or cirri, and the gut. Next, we examine whether there are differences between the microbiome of each body tissue of barnacles collected from the thermally extreme microhabitats of the rocky shores’ upper and lower tidal zones.\n\nResults\nOverall, the microbiome of S. balanoides consisted of 18 phyla from 408 genera. Our results showed that although cirri and gut microbiomes shared a portion of their amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), the microbiome of each body tissue was distinct. Over 80% of the ASVs found in the cirri were also found in the gut, and 44% of the ASVs found in the gut were also found in the cirri. Notably, the gut microbiome was not a subset of the cirri microbiome. Additionally, we identified that the cirri microbiome was responsive to microhabitat differences.\n\nConclusion\nResults from this study indicate that S. balanoides maintains distinct microbiomes in its cirri and gut tissues, and that the gut microbiome is more stable than the cirri microbiome between the extremes of the intertidal.",

Each is a specific hypothesis, drawn from among many alternative hypotheses, of the sequence of a genome. Assembly uncertainty, the inability to distinguish between multiple alternative assembly hypotheses, can be due to real variation between copies of the genome in the sample, errors and ambiguities in the sequenced data and assumptions and heuristics of the assemblers. Most assemblers select a single assembly according to ad hoc criteria, and do not yet report and quantify the uncertainty of their outputs. Those assemblers that do report uncertainty take different approaches to describing multiple assembly hypotheses and the support for each.\n               Results: Here we review and examine the problem of representing and measuring uncertainty in assemblies. A promising recent development is the implementation of assemblers that are built according to explicit statistical models. Some new assembly methods, for example, estimate and maximize assembly likelihood. These advances, combined with technical advances in the representation of alternative assembly hypotheses, will lead to a more complete and biologically relevant understanding of assembly uncertainty. This will in turn facilitate the interpretation of downstream analyses and tests of specific biological hypotheses.\n               Contact:  mhowison@brown.edu",

    "abstract": "AbstractModels in which the mantle of the Moon evolves from an initially stratified state following magma ocean solidification and overturn have been applied to address important features of long‐term thermal evolution of the Moon, including convective instability of overturned ilmenite‐bearing cumulates (IBC) at the lunar core‐mantle boundary, generation of mare basalts, core sulfur content and inner core radius, paleomagnetism, and the present‐day mantle structure. Whether a dense overturned IBC‐rich layer at the bottom of the mantle can become thermally unstable to generate a single upwelling is controlled largely by the temperature‐dependence of viscosity (the activation energy). Convective instability of the IBC‐rich layer controls the heat flux out the core and the presence of an internally generated magnetic field. A long period of (~700 Ma) high positive core‐mantle‐boundary (CMB) heat flux after the instability of the IBC‐rich layer is expected from our models. Present‐day deep mantle temperatures inferred from seismic and gravitational inversion constrain the magnitude of mantle viscosity from 5 × 1019 to 1 × 1021 Pa s. The CMB temperature and solidified inner core radius inferred from seismic reflection constrain the core sulfur content. Our evolution models with 5–10 wt % sulfur content can produce the observed 240 km radius inner core at the present day. The asymmetrical distribution of the deep moonquakes only in the nearside mantle could be explained as the remnant structure of the single chemical upwelling generated from IBC‐rich layer. Our evolution model after the overturn results in an early ~0.55 km expansion in radius for ~1000 Ma due to the radiogenic heating associated with IBC in the deep mantle and may provide a simple explanation for the early expansion inferred from the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory mission.",

The joint experimental and theoretical investigation shows that B24− possesses a quasi-planar structure containing fifteen outer and nine inner atoms with six of the inner atoms forming a filled pentagonal moiety. The central atom of the pentagonal moiety is puckered out of plane by 0.9 Å, reminiscent of the six-atom pentagonal caps of the well-known B12 icosahedral unit. The next closest isomer at the ROCCSD(T) level of theory has a tubular double-ring structure. Comparison of the simulated spectra with the experimental data shows that the global minimum quasi-planar B24− isomer is the major contributor to the observed photoelectron spectrum, while the tubular isomer has no contribution to the experiment. Chemical bonding analyses reveal that the periphery of the quasi-planar B24 constitutes 15 classical 2c-2e B-B σ-bonds, whereas delocalized σ- and π-bonds are found in the interior of the cluster with one unique 6c-2e π-bond responsible for bonding in the B-centered pentagon. The current work suggests that the 24-atom boron cluster continues to be quasi-2D, albeit the tendency to form filled pentagonal units, characteristic of 3D cage-like structures of bulk boron, is observed.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is beneficial for various types of learning and memory, including a finger-tapping motor-sequence task. However, methodological issues hinder clarification of the crucial cortical regions for sleep-dependent consolidation in motor-sequence learning. Here, to investigate the core cortical region for sleep-dependent consolidation of finger-tapping motor-sequence learning, while human subjects were asleep, we measured spontaneous cortical oscillations by magnetoencephalography together with polysomnography, and source-localized the origins of oscillations using individual anatomical brain information from MRI. First, we confirmed that performance of the task at a retest session after sleep significantly increased compared with performance at the training session before sleep. Second, spontaneous δ and fast-σ oscillations significantly increased in the supplementary motor area (SMA) during post-training compared with pretraining sleep, showing significant and high correlation with the performance increase. Third, the increased spontaneous oscillations in the SMA correlated with performance improvement were specific to slow-wave sleep. We also found that correlations of δ oscillation between the SMA and the prefrontal and between the SMA and the parietal regions tended to decrease after training. These results suggest that a core brain region for sleep-dependent consolidation of the finger-tapping motor-sequence learning resides in the SMA contralateral to the trained hand and is mediated by spontaneous δ and fast-σ oscillations, especially during slow-wave sleep. The consolidation may arise along with possible reorganization of a larger-scale cortical network that involves the SMA and cortical regions outside the motor regions, including prefrontal and parietal regions.",

    "abstract": "Tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) and the myogenic mechanism combine in each nephron to regulate blood flow and glomerular filtration rate. Both mechanisms are nonlinear, generate self-sustained oscillations, and interact as their signals converge on arteriolar smooth muscle, forming a regulatory ensemble. Ensembles may synchronize. Smooth muscle cells in the ensemble depolarize periodically, generating electrical signals that propagate along the vascular network. We developed a mathematical model of a nephron-vascular network, with 16 versions of a single nephron model containing representations of both mechanisms in the regulatory ensemble, to examine the effects of network structure on nephron synchronization. Symmetry, as a property of a network, facilitates synchronization. Nephrons received blood from a symmetric electrically conductive vascular tree. Symmetry was created by using identical nephron models at each of the 16 sites and symmetry breaking by varying nephron length. The symmetric model achieved synchronization of all elements in the network. As little as 1% variation in nephron length caused extensive desynchronization, although synchronization was maintained in small nephron clusters. In-phase synchronization predominated among nephrons separated by one or three vascular nodes and antiphase synchronization for five or seven nodes of separation. Nephron dynamics were irregular and contained low-frequency fluctuations. Results are consistent with simultaneous blood flow measurements in multiple nephrons. An interaction between electrical signals propagated through the network to cause synchronization; variation in vascular pressure at vessel bifurcations was a principal cause of desynchronization. The results suggest that the vasculature supplies blood to nephrons but also engages in robust information transfer.",

In contrast, data on the invertebrate-infecting gregarines remains sparse and their evolutionary relationship to other apicomplexans remains obscure. Most apicomplexans retain a highly modified plastid, while their mitochondria remain metabolically conserved. Cryptosporidium spp. inhabit an anaerobic host-gut environment and represent the known exception, having completely lost their plastid while retaining an extremely reduced mitochondrion that has lost its genome. Recent advances in single-cell sequencing have enabled the first broad genome-scale explorations of gregarines, providing evidence of differential plastid retention throughout the group. However, little is known about the retention and metabolic capacity of gregarine mitochondria.\n              \n                Results\n                Here, we sequenced transcriptomes from five species of gregarines isolated from cockroaches. We combined these data with those from other apicomplexans, performed detailed phylogenomic analyses, and characterized their mitochondrial metabolism. Our results support the placement of Cryptosporidium as the earliest diverging lineage of apicomplexans, which impacts our interpretation of evolutionary events within the phylum. By mapping in silico predictions of core mitochondrial pathways onto our phylogeny, we identified convergently reduced mitochondria. These data show that the electron transport chain has been independently lost three times across the phylum, twice within gregarines.\n              \n                Conclusions\n                Apicomplexan lineages show variable functional restructuring of mitochondrial metabolism that appears to have been driven by adaptations to parasitism and anaerobiosis.

Numerous calibration methods for MSMs have been suggested in the literature, most of which are usually adjusted to the specific needs of the model and based on subjective criteria for the selection of optimal parameter values. This article compares 2 general approaches for calibrating MSMs used in medical decision making, a Bayesian and an empirical approach. We use as a tool the MIcrosimulation Lung Cancer (MILC) model, a streamlined, continuous-time, dynamic MSM that describes the natural history of lung cancer and predicts individual trajectories accounting for age, sex, and smoking habits. We apply both methods to calibrate MILC to observed lung cancer incidence rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. We compare the results from the 2 methods in terms of the resulting parameter distributions, model predictions, and efficiency. Although the empirical method proves more practical, producing similar results with smaller computational effort, the Bayesian method resulted in a calibrated model that produced more accurate outputs for rare events and is based on a well-defined theoretical framework for the evaluation and interpretation of the calibration outcomes. A combination of the 2 approaches is an alternative worth considering for calibrating complex predictive models, such as microsimulation models.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe northern acorn barnacle (Semibalanus balanoides) is a robust system to study the genetic basis of adaptations to highly heterogeneous environments. Adult barnacles may be exposed to highly dissimilar levels of thermal stress depending on where they settle in the intertidal (i.e., closer to the upper or lower tidal boundary). For instance, barnacles near the upper tidal limit experience episodic summer temperatures above recorded heat coma levels. This differential stress at the microhabitat level is also dependent on the aspect of sun exposure. In the present study, we used pool‐seq approaches to conduct a genome wide screen for loci responding to intertidal zonation across the North Atlantic basin (Maine, Rhode Island, and Norway). Our analysis discovered 382 genomic regions containing SNPs which are consistently zonated (i.e., SNPs whose frequencies vary depending on their position in the rocky intertidal) across all surveyed habitats. Notably, most zonated SNPs are young and private to the North Atlantic. These regions show high levels of genetic differentiation across ecologically extreme microhabitats concomitant with elevated levels of genetic variation and Tajima's D, suggesting the action of non‐neutral processes. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that spatially heterogeneous selection is a general and repeatable feature for this species, and that natural selection can maintain functional genetic variation in heterogeneous environments.",

We propose a particle production mechanism that could improve the depletion of the inflaton energy density by up to four orders of magnitude. The improvement comes from the fast perturbative decays of resonantly produced daughter particles. They act as a “spillway” to drain these daughter particles, reducing their backreaction on the inflaton and keeping the resonant production effective for a longer period. Thus we dub the scenario “spillway preheating”. We also show that the fraction of energy density remaining in the inflaton has a simple inverse power-law scaling in the scenario. In general, spillway preheating is a much more efficient energy dissipation mechanism, which may have other applications in model building for particle physics.",

We demonstrated the use of a genetically encoded calcium indicator combined with a novel live-imaging platform to record spontaneous calcium transients in microtissues from day 14-34 in vitro. We implemented graph theory analysis of calcium activity to characterize underlying functional connectivity and community structure of microcircuits, which are capable of capturing subtle changes in network dynamics during early diseases states. We found that microtissues cultured for 34 days displayed functional remodeling of microcircuits and that community structure strengthened over time. Lipopolysaccharide, a neuroinflammatory agent, significantly increased functional connectivity and disrupted community structure 5-9 days after exposure. These microcircuit-level changes have broad implications for the role of neuroinflammation in functional dysregulation of neural networks.",

The changes in behavior were organized in behavioral profiles, which were examined by hierarchical cluster analysis. One of the identified clusters includes the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus (FK506), which are immunosuppressants and potential therapeutics in the prevention of Alzheimer’s disease. The calcineurin inhibitors form a functional cluster with seemingly unrelated drugs, including bromocriptine, tetrabenazine, rosiglitazone, nebivolol, sorafenib, cabozantinib, tamoxifen, meclizine, and salmeterol.

Previously, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used to characterize the hydrodynamic response with respect to specific geometric features. However simulations are time intensive due to complex three-dimensional meshing and computation time, limiting the number of geometric perturbations explored. A method is proposed in which the specific geometric features of this complex topography can be modified during a simulation thereby decreasing the time per geometric modification and removing the need for manual meshing of the complex structure. The surface of the seal whisker inspired geometry is parameterized into seven defining parameters, each of which is directly controlled in order to morph the surface into any realization within the defined parameter space. Once validated, the algorithm is used to explore the undulation amplitudes in the chord and thickness directions, by varying each independently from 0 to 0.3 thicknesses in increments of 0.05 at a Reynolds number of 500. The force and frequency response are examined for this matrix of geometric parameters, yielding detailed force trends not previously investigated. The impact of the bio-inspired morphing algorithm will allow for further optimization and development of force-mitigating underwater devices and other engineering applications in need of vibration suppression, frequency tuning, or force reduction.",

Here, we seek to characterize the computational demands for abstract visual reasoning. We do this by systematically assessing the ability of modern deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn to solve the synthetic visual reasoning test (SVRT) challenge, a collection of 23 visual reasoning problems. Our analysis reveals a novel taxonomy of visual reasoning tasks, which can be primarily explained by both the type of relations (same-different versus spatial-relation judgments) and the number of relations used to compose the underlying rules. Prior cognitive neuroscience work suggests that attention plays a key role in humans' visual reasoning ability. To test this hypothesis, we extended the CNNs with spatial and feature-based attention mechanisms. In a second series of experiments, we evaluated the ability of these attention networks to learn to solve the SVRT challenge and found the resulting architectures to be much more efficient at solving the hardest of these visual reasoning tasks. Most important, the corresponding improvements on individual tasks partially explained our novel taxonomy. Overall, this work provides a granular computational account of visual reasoning and yields testable neuroscience predictions regarding the differential need for feature-based versus spatial attention depending on the type of visual reasoning problem.",

In the USA, public health departments routinely conduct contact tracing and partner services and interview newly HIV-diagnosed index cases to obtain information on social networks and guide prevention interventions. Sequence clustering methods able to infer HIV networks have been used to investigate and halt outbreaks. Incorporation of such methods into routine, not only outbreak-driven, contact tracing and partner services holds promise for further disruption of HIV transmissions.Methods and analysisBuilding on a strong academic–public health collaboration in Rhode Island, we designed and have implemented a state-wide prospective study to evaluate an intervention that incorporates real-time HIV molecular clustering information with routine contact tracing and partner services. We present the rationale and study design of our approach to integrate sequence clustering methods into routine public health interventions as well as related important ethical considerations. This prospective study addresses key questions about the benefit of incorporating a clustering analysis triggered intervention into the routine workflow of public health departments, going beyond outbreak-only circumstances. By developing an intervention triggered by, and incorporating information from, viral sequence clustering analysis, and evaluating it with a novel design that avoids randomisation while allowing for methods comparison, we are confident that this study will inform how viral sequence clustering analysis can be routinely integrated into public health to support the ending of the HIV pandemic in the USA and beyond.Ethics and disseminationThe study was approved by both the Lifespan and Rhode Island Department of Health Human Subjects Research Institutional Review Boards and study results will be published in peer-reviewed journals.",

However, given the long-standing challenge of quantifying emotion and the narrow framework in which emotion is traditionally examined, it remains unclear which emotions are actually associated with motivating these types of choices. To address this gap, we combine machine learning algorithms with a measure of affect that is agnostic to any specific emotion label. The result is a probabilistic map of emotion that is used to classify the specific emotions experienced by participants in a variety of social interactions (Ultimatum Game, Prisoner’s Dilemma, and Public Goods Game). Our results reveal that punitive and uncooperative choices are linked to a diverse array of negative, neutrally arousing emotions, such as sadness and disappointment, while only weakly linked to anger. These findings stand in contrast to the commonly held assumption that anger drives decisions to punish, defect, and freeride—thus, offering new insight into the role of emotion in motiving social choice.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Low-frequency radio observatories are reaching unprecedented levels of sensitivity in an effort to detect the 21 cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn. High precision is needed because the expected signal is overwhelmed by foreground contamination, largely from so-called diffuse emission—a nonlocalized glow comprising Galactic synchrotron emission and radio galaxies. The impact of this diffuse emission on observations may be better understood through detailed simulations, which evaluate the Radio Interferometry Measurement Equation (RIME) for a given instrument and sky model. Evaluating the RIME involves carrying out an integral over the full sky, which is naturally discretized for point sources but must be approximated for diffuse emission. The choice of integration scheme can introduce errors that must be understood and isolated from the instrumental effects under study. In this paper, we present several analytically defined patterns of unpolarized diffuse sky emission for which the RIME integral is manageable, yielding closed-form or series visibility functions. We demonstrate the usefulness of these RIME solutions for validation by comparing them to simulated data and show that the remaining differences behave as expected with varied sky resolution and baseline orientation and length.",

    "abstract": "A challenge of atomistic machine-learning (ML) methods is ensuring that the training data are suitable for the system being simulated, which is particularly challenging for systems with large numbers of atoms. Most atomistic ML approaches rely on the nearsightedness principle (“all chemistry is local”), using information about the position of an atom’s neighbors to predict a per-atom energy. In this work, we develop a framework that exploits the nearsighted nature of ML models to systematically produce an appropriate training set for large structures. We use a per-atom uncertainty estimate to identify the most uncertain atoms and extract chunks centered around these atoms. It is crucial that these small chunks are both large enough to satisfy the ML’s nearsighted principle (that is, filling the cutoff radius) and are large enough to be converged with respect to the electronic structure calculation. We present data indicating when the electronic structure calculations are converged with respect to the structure size, which fundamentally limits the accuracy of any nearsighted ML calculator. These new atomic chunks are calculated in electronic structures, and crucially, only a single force—that of the central atom—is added to the growing training set, preventing the noisy and irrelevant information from the piece’s boundary from interfering with ML training. The resulting ML potentials are robust, despite requiring single-point calculations on only small reference structures and never seeing large training structures. We demonstrated our approach via structure optimization of a 260-atom structure and extended the approach to clusters with up to 1415 atoms.",

    "abstract": "Abstract\n               Siphonophores are complex colonial animals, consisting of asexually produced bodies (zooids) that are functionally specialized for specific tasks, including feeding, swimming, and sexual reproduction. Though this extreme functional specialization has captivated biologists for generations, its genomic underpinnings remain unknown. We use RNA-seq to investigate gene expression patterns in five zooids and one specialized tissue across seven siphonophore species. Analyses of gene expression across species present several challenges, including identification of comparable expression changes on gene trees with complex histories of speciation, duplication, and loss. We examine gene expression within species, conduct classical analyses examining expression patterns between species, and introduce species branch filtering, which allows us to examine the evolution of expression across species in a phylogenetic framework. Within and across species, we identified hundreds of zooid-specific and species-specific genes, as well as a number of putative transcription factors showing differential expression in particular zooids and developmental stages. We found that gene expression patterns tended to be largely consistent in zooids with the same function across species, but also some large lineage-specific shifts in gene expression. Our findings show that patterns of gene expression have the potential to define zooids in colonial organisms. Traditional analyses of the evolution of gene expression focus on the tips of gene phylogenies, identifying large-scale expression patterns that are zooid or species variable. The new explicit phylogenetic approach we propose here focuses on branches (not tips) offering a deeper evolutionary perspective into specific changes in gene expression within zooids along all branches of the gene (and species) trees.",

    "abstract": "The first magnetic 2D material discovered, monolayer (ML) CrI3, is particularly fascinating due to its ground state ferromagnetism. However, because ML materials are difficult to probe experimentally, much remains unresolved about ML CrI3’s structural, electronic, and magnetic properties. Here, we leverage Density Functional Theory (DFT) and high-accuracy Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) simulations to predict lattice parameters, magnetic moments, and spin–phonon and spin–lattice coupling of ML CrI3. We exploit a recently developed surrogate Hessian DMC line search technique to determine CrI3’s ML geometry with DMC accuracy, yielding lattice parameters in good agreement with recently published STM measurements—an accomplishment given the ∼10% variability in previous DFT-derived estimates depending upon the functional. Strikingly, we find that previous DFT predictions of ML CrI3’s magnetic spin moments are correct on average across a unit cell but miss critical local spatial fluctuations in the spin density revealed by more accurate DMC. DMC predicts that magnetic moments in ML CrI3 are 3.62 μB per chromium and −0.145 μB per iodine, both larger than previous DFT predictions. The large disparate moments together with the large spin–orbit coupling of CrI3’s I-p orbital suggest a ligand superexchange-dominated magnetic anisotropy in ML CrI3, corroborating recent observations of magnons in its 2D limit. We also find that ML CrI3 exhibits a substantial spin–phonon coupling of ∼3.32 cm−1. Our work, thus, establishes many of ML CrI3’s key properties, while also continuing to demonstrate the pivotal role that DMC can assume in the study of magnetic and other 2D materials.",

    "abstract": "Tremor, a common and often primary symptom of Parkinson's disease, has been modeled with distinct onset and maintenance dynamics. To identify the neurophysiologic correlates of each state, we acquired intraoperative cortical and subthalamic nucleus recordings from 10 patients (9 male, 1 female) performing a naturalistic visual–motor task. From this task, we isolated short epochs of tremor onset and sustained tremor. Comparing these epochs, we found that the subthalamic nucleus was central to tremor onset, as it drove both motor cortical activity and tremor output. Once tremor became sustained, control of tremor shifted to cortex. At the same time, changes in directed functional connectivity across sensorimotor cortex further distinguished the sustained tremor state.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTremor is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). While tremor pathophysiology is thought to involve both basal ganglia and cerebello–thalamic–cortical circuits, it is unknown how these structures functionally interact to produce tremor. In this article, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex in patients with PD undergoing deep brain stimulation surgery. Using an intraoperative task, we examined tremor in two separate dynamic contexts: when tremor first emerged, and when tremor was sustained. We believe that these findings reconcile several models of Parkinson's tremor, while describing the short-timescale dynamics of subcortical–cortical interactions during tremor for the first time. These findings may describe a framework for developing proactive and responsive neurostimulation models for specifically treating tremor.",

We find the ability to infer friendships depends on a simple but inflexible heuristic that infers friendship when two people share the same features, and a more complex but flexible cognitive map that encodes relationships between features rather than between people. Our results reveal that cognitive maps play a powerful role in shaping how people represent and reason about relationships in a social network.",

Here, an investigation of how hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) interacts with the cell membrane is carried out by combining molecular dynamics (MD), liquid‐phase exfoliation, and in vitro imaging methods. MD simulations reveal that a sharp hBN wedge can penetrate a lipid bilayer and form a cross‐membrane water channel along its exposed polar edges, while a round hBN sheet does not exhibit this behavior. It is hypothesized that such water channels can facilitate cross‐membrane transport, with important consequences including lysosomal membrane permeabilization, an emerging mechanism of cellular toxicity that involves the release of cathepsin B and generation of radical oxygen species leading to cell apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, two types of hBN nanosheets, one with a rhomboidal, cornered morphology and one with a round morphology, are prepared, and human lung epithelial cells are exposed to both materials. The cornered hBN with lateral polar edges results in a dose‐dependent cytotoxic effect, whereas round hBN does not cause significant toxicity, thus confirming our premise.",

    "abstract": "AbstractObjectiveLaser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) is typically performed with one trajectory to target the medial temporal lobe (MTL). MTL structures such as piriform and entorhinal cortex are epileptogenic, but due to their relative geometry, they are difficult to target with one trajectory while simultaneously maintaining adequate ablation of the amygdala and hippocampus. We hypothesized that a two‐trajectory approach could improve ablation of all relevant MTL structures. First, we created large‐scale computer simulations to compare idealized one‐ vs two‐trajectory approaches. A two‐trajectory approach was then validated in an initial cohort of patients.MethodsWe used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to create subject‐specific target structures consisting of hippocampus, amygdala, and piriform/entorhinal/perirhinal cortex. An algorithm searched for safe potential trajectories along the hippocampal axis (catheter one) and along the amygdala‐piriform axis (catheter two) and compared this to a single trajectory optimized over all structures. The proportion of each structure ablated at various burn radii was evaluated. A cohort of 11 consecutive patients with mTLE received two‐trajectory LITT; demographic, operative, and outcome data were collected.ResultsThe two‐trajectory approach was superior to the one‐trajectory approach at nearly all burn radii for all hippocampal subfields and amygdala nuclei (p &lt; .05). Two‐laser trajectories achieved full ablation of MTL cortical structures at physiologically realistic burn radii, whereas one‐laser trajectories could not. Five patients with at least 1 year of follow‐up (mean = 21.8 months) experienced Engel class I outcomes; 6 patients with less than 1 year of follow‐up (mean = 6.6 months) are on track for Engel class I outcomes.SignificanceOur anatomic analyses and initial clinical results suggest that LITT amygdalohippocampotomy performed via two‐laser trajectories may promote excellent seizure outcomes. Future studies are required to validate the long‐term clinical efficacy and safety of this approach.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWe investigated the interaction between surface conditions and precipitating convection by comparing the Amazon River against the surrounding forest. Despite similar synoptic conditions within a few tens of kilometers, the river surface is substantially cooler than the surrounding forest during the day and warmer at night. We analyzed 20 years of high‐resolution satellite precipitation data and confirmed previous findings of daytime rainfall reduction over the river for the whole Amazon Basin. The percentage reduction is strongest during the dry‐to‐wet transition season. In addition, the percentage reduction of individual tributary is significantly correlated with the Laplacian of surface temperature, which causes thermally driven surface divergence and suppresses local convection. Additionally, nighttime rainfall is enhanced over tributaries near the Atlantic coast during the wet season. A regional climate model then simulates the local rainfall anomalies associated with the river. Above the river, moisture diverges near the surface and converges above the surface before the daytime rainfall, partially driven by the horizontal gradient of humidity. Unlike the river, moisture convergence within the boundary layer is more critical for the rainfall above the forest region. Our studies suggest that strong thermal contrast can be important in deriving heterogeneous convection in moist tropical regions.",

This study discusses the physical aspects of the estuary (Narragansett and Mount Hope Bays and larger rivers) to evaluate physical circulation predictability. This estimate is intended to help decide if a forecast and prediction system is warranted, to prepare for coupling with biogeochemistry and fisheries models with widely disparate timescales, and to find the spin‐up time needed to establish the climatological circulation of the region. Perturbed initial condition ensemble simulations are combined with metrics from information theory to quantify the predictability of the OSOM forecast system–i.e., how long anomalies from different initial conditions persist. The predictability timescale in this model agrees with readily estimable timescales such as the freshwater flushing timescale evaluated using the total exchange flow (TEF) framework, indicating that the estuarine dynamics rather than chaotic transport is the dominant model behavior limiting predictions. The predictability of the OSOM is ∼7–40 days, varying with parameters, region, and season.",

We illustrate how this possibility can be rapidly tested by integrating Calphad modeling into the high-throughput loop. As an example, we investigate the Ni-Re system, in which D019 and D1a phases were predicted as possible intermetallic compounds.

Many of these genes harbor mutations maintained across 2 My of evolution between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

The data also reveal complex population structure within and between basins, driven by the trans-Arctic interchange and the last glaciation.

    "abstract": "Finite temperature auxiliary field-based quantum Monte Carlo methods, including determinant quantum Monte Carlo and Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), have historically assumed pivotal roles in the investigation of the finite temperature phase diagrams of a wide variety of multidimensional lattice models and materials. Despite their utility, however, these techniques are typically formulated in the grand canonical ensemble, which makes them difficult to apply to condensates such as superfluids and difficult to benchmark against alternative methods that are formulated in the canonical ensemble. Working in the grand canonical ensemble is furthermore accompanied by the increased overhead associated with having to determine the chemical potentials that produce desired fillings. Given this backdrop, in this work, we present a new recursive approach for performing AFQMC simulations in the canonical ensemble that does not require knowledge of chemical potentials. To derive this approach, we exploit the convenient fact that AFQMC solves the many-body problem by decoupling many-body propagators into integrals over one-body problems to which non-interacting theories can be applied. We benchmark the accuracy of our technique on illustrative Bose and Fermi–Hubbard models and demonstrate that it can converge more quickly to the ground state than grand canonical AFQMC simulations. We believe that our novel use of HS-transformed operators to implement algorithms originally derived for non-interacting systems will motivate the development of a variety of other methods and anticipate that our technique will enable direct performance comparisons against other many-body approaches formulated in the canonical ensemble.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo develop and validate a Monte Carlo model of the Varian TrueBeam to study electron collimation using the existing photon multi‐leaf collimators (pMLC), instead of conventional electron applicators and apertures.Materials and MethodsA complete Monte Carlo model of the Varian TrueBeam was developed using Tool for particle simulation (TOPAS) (version 3.1.p3). Vendor‐supplied information was used to model the treatment head components and the source parameters. A phase space plane was setup above the collimating jaws and captured particles were reused until a statistical uncertainty of 1% was achieved in the central axis. Electron energies 6, 9, 12, 16, and 20 MeV with a jaw‐defined field of 20 × 20 cm2 at iso‐center, pMLC‐defined fields of 6.8 × 6.8 cm2 and 11.4 × 11.4 cm2 at 80 cm source‐to‐surface distance (SSD) and an applicator‐defined field of 10 × 10 cm2 at iso‐center were evaluated. All the measurements except the applicator‐defined fields were measured using an ionization chamber in a water tank using 80 cm SSD. The dose difference, distance‐to‐agreement and gamma index were used to evaluate the agreement between the Monte Carlo calculations and measurements. Contributions of electron scattering off pMLC leaves and inter‐leaf leakage on dose profiles were evaluated and compared with Monte Carlo calculations. Electron transport through a heterogeneous phantom was simulated and the resulting dose distributions were compared with film measurements. The validated Monte Carlo model was used to simulate several clinically motivated cases to demonstrate the benefit of pMLC‐based electron delivery compared to applicator‐based electron delivery.ResultsCalculated and measured percentage depth‐dose (PDD) curves agree within 2% after normalization. The agreement between normalized percentage depth dose curves were evaluated using one‐dimensional gamma analysis with a local tolerance of 2%/1 mm and the %points passing gamma criteria was 100% for all energies. For jaw‐defined fields, calculated profiles agree with measurements with pass rates of &gt;97% for 2%/2 mm gamma criteria. Calculated FWHM and penumbra width agree with measurements within 0.4 cm. For fields with tertiary collimation using an pMLC or applicator, the average gamma pass rate of compared profiles was 98% with 2%/2 mm gamma criteria. The profiles measured to evaluate the pMLC leaf scattering agreed with Monte Carlo calculations with an average gamma pass rate of 96.5% with 3%/2 mm gamma criteria. Measured dose profiles below the heterogenous phantom agreed well with calculated profiles and matched within 2.5% for most points. The calculated clinically applicable cases using TOPAS MC and Eclipse TPS for single enface electron beam, electron‐photon mixed beam and a matched electron‐electron beam exhibited a reasonable agreement in PDDs, profiles and dose volume histograms.ConclusionWe present a validation of a Monte Carlo model of Varian TrueBeam for pMLC‐based electron delivery. Monte Carlo calculations agreed with measurements satisfying gamma criterion of 1%/1 mm for depth dose curves and 2%/1 mm for dose profiles. The simulation of clinically applicable cases demonstrated the clinical utility of pMLC‐based electrons and the use of MC simulations for development of advanced radiation therapy techniques.",

Bright radio emission from foreground sources remains the biggest obstacle to detecting the faint 21 cm signal. However, the expected smoothness of foreground power leaves a clean window in Fourier space where the EoR signal can potentially be seen over thermal noise. Though the boundary of this window is well defined in principle, spectral structure in foreground sources, instrumental chromaticity, and choice of spectral weighting in analysis all affect how much foreground power spills over into the EoR window. In this paper, we run a suite of numerical simulations of wide-field visibility measurements, with a variety of diffuse foreground models and instrument configurations, and measure the extent of contaminated Fourier modes in the EoR window using a delay-transform approach to estimate power spectra. We also test these effects with a model of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) antenna beam generated from electromagnetic simulations, to take into account further chromatic effects in the real instrument. We find that foreground power spillover is dominated by the so-called pitchfork effect, in which diffuse foreground power is brightened near the horizon due to the shortening of baselines. As a result, the extent of contaminated modes in the EoR window is largely constant over time, except when the Galaxy is near the pointing centre.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPrecise instrumental calibration is of crucial importance to 21-cm cosmology experiments. The Murchison Widefield Array’s (MWA) Phase II compact configuration offers us opportunities for both redundant calibration and sky-based calibration algorithms; using the two in tandem is a potential approach to mitigate calibration errors caused by inaccurate sky models. The MWA Epoch of Reionization (EoR) experiment targets three patches of the sky (dubbed EoR0, EoR1, and EoR2) with deep observations. Previous work in Li et al. (2018) and (2019) studied the effect of tandem calibration on the EoR0 field and found that it yielded no significant improvement in the power spectrum (PS) over sky-based calibration alone. In this work, we apply similar techniques to the EoR1 field and find a distinct result: the improvements in the PS from tandem calibration are significant. To understand this result, we analyse both the calibration solutions themselves and the effects on the PS over three nights of EoR1 observations. We conclude that the presence of the bright radio galaxy Fornax A in EoR1 degrades the performance of sky-based calibration, which in turn enables redundant calibration to have a larger impact. These results suggest that redundant calibration can indeed mitigate some level of model incompleteness error.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe assembly and function of mitochondria require coordinated expression from two distinct genomes, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nuclear DNA (nDNA). Mutations in either genome can be a source of phenotypic variation, yet their coexpression has been largely overlooked as a source of variation, particularly in the emerging paradigm of mitochondrial replacement therapy. Here we tested how the transcriptome responds to mtDNA and nDNA variation, along with mitonuclear interactions (mtDNA × nDNA) in Drosophila melanogaster. We used two mtDNA haplotypes that differ in a substantial number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, with &amp;gt;100 amino acid differences. We placed each haplotype on each of two D. melanogaster nuclear backgrounds and tested for transcription differences in both sexes. We found that large numbers of transcripts were differentially expressed between nuclear backgrounds, and that mtDNA type altered the expression of nDNA genes, suggesting a retrograde, trans effect of mitochondrial genotype. Females were generally more sensitive to genetic perturbation than males, and males demonstrated an asymmetrical effect of mtDNA in each nuclear background; mtDNA effects were nuclear-background specific. mtDNA-sensitive genes were not enriched in male- or female-limited expression space in either sex. Using a variety of differential expression analyses, we show the responses to mitonuclear covariation to be substantially different between the sexes, yet the mtDNA genes were consistently differentially expressed across nuclear backgrounds and sexes. Our results provide evidence that the main mtDNA effects can be consistent across nuclear backgrounds, but the interactions between mtDNA and nDNA can lead to sex-specific global transcript responses.",

    "abstract": "When an elastic thin-film/substrate bilayer is cyclically compressed with a large plane-strain stroke, various surface morphologies develop either reversibly or irreversibly with cyclic hysteresis. Here, we examine the cyclic morphology evolution with extensive finite-element analyses and present a generic irreversibility map on the primary bilayer Ruga-phase diagram (PB-RPD). The term “PB” refers to a system of a film on a substrate, both of which are incompressible neo-Hookean, while the term “Ruga-phase” refers to the classification of corrugated surface morphologies. Our generic map reveals two configurational irreversibility types of Ruga-phases during a loading and unloading cycle. One, localization irreversibility, is caused by unstable crease localization and the other, modal irreversibility, by unstable mode transitions of wrinkle-Ruga configurations. While the instability of crease localization depends mainly on smoothness of the creasing surface or interface, the instability of Ruga-mode transition is sensitive to film/substrate stiffness ratio, film/substrate strain mismatch (εps), and material viscosity of the bilayer. For small strain mismatches (εps ≲ 0.5), PB Ruga structures are ordered; otherwise, for large strain mismatches, the Ruga structures can evolve to ridge configurations. For evolution of ordered Ruga phases, the configurational irreversibility leads to shake-down or divergence of cyclic hysteresis. Underlying mechanisms of the cyclic hysteresis are found to be the unstable Ruga-phase transitions of mode-period multiplications in the loading cycle, followed by either mode “locking” or primary-period “switching” in the unloading cycle. In addition, we found that the primary-period switching is promoted by the strain mismatch and material viscosity. These results indicate that various Ruga configurations can be excited, and thus, diverse Ruga-phases can coexist, under cyclic loading. Our irreversibility map will be useful in controlling reversibility as well as uniformity of Ruga configurations in many practical applications.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessels have unique properties that allow them to function together within a complex, self-regulating network. The contractile capacity of the wall combined with complex mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix enables vessels to adapt to changes in haemodynamic loading. Homogenized phenomenological and multi-constituent, structurally motivated continuum models have successfully captured these mechanical properties, but truly describing intricate microstructural details of the arterial wall may require a discrete framework. Such an approach would facilitate modelling interactions between or the separation of layers of the wall and would offer the advantage of seamless integration with discrete models of complex blood flow. We present a discrete particle model of a multi-constituent, nonlinearly elastic, anisotropic arterial wall, which we develop using the dissipative particle dynamics method. Mimicking basic features of the microstructure of the arterial wall, the model comprises an elastin matrix having isotropic nonlinear elastic properties plus anisotropic fibre reinforcement that represents the stiffer collagen fibres of the wall. These collagen fibres are distributed evenly and are oriented in four directions, symmetric to the vessel axis. Experimental results from biaxial mechanical tests of an artery are used for model validation, and a delamination test is simulated to demonstrate the new capabilities of the model.",

    "abstract": "AbstractWrinkles as intrinsic topological feature have been expected to affect the electrical and mechanical properties of atomically thin graphene. Molecular dynamics simulations are adopted to investigate the wrinkling characteristics in hydrogenated graphene annulus under circular shearing at the inner edge. The amplitude of wrinkles induced by in-plane rotation around the inner edge is sensitive to hydrogenation and increases quadratically with hydrogen coverage. The effect of hydrogenation on mechanical properties is investigated by calculating the torque capability of annular graphene with varying hydrogen coverage and inner radius. Hydrogenation-enhanced wrinkles cause the aggregation of carbon atoms towards the inner edge and contribute to the critical torque strength of annulus. Based on detailed stress distribution contours, a shear-to-tension conversion mechanism is proposed for the contribution of wrinkles on torque capacity. As a result, the graphane annulus anomalously has similar torque capacity to pristine graphene annulus. The competition between hydrogenation caused bond strength deterioration and wrinkling induced local stress state conversion leads to a U-shaped evolution of torque strength relative to the increase of hydrogen coverage from 0 to 100%. Such hydrogenation tailored topological and mechanical characteristics provides an innovative mean to develop novel graphene-based devices.",

    "abstract": "The performance of metal oxides as redox materials is limited by their oxygen conductivity and thermochemical stability. Predicting these properties from the electronic structure can support the screening of advanced metal oxides and accelerate their development for clean energy applications. Specifically, reducible metal oxide catalysts and potential redox materials for the solar‐thermochemical splitting of CO2 and H2O via an isothermal redox cycle are examined. A volcano‐type correlation is developed from available experimental data and density functional theory. It is found that the energy of the oxygen‐vacancy formation at the most stable surfaces of TiO2, Ti2O3, Cu2O, ZnO, ZrO2, MoO3, Ag2O, CeO2, yttria‐stabilized zirconia, and three perovskites scales with the Gibbs free energy of formation of the bulk oxides. Analogously, the experimental oxygen self‐diffusion constants correlate with the transition‐state energy of oxygen conduction. A simple descriptor is derived for rapid screening of oxygen‐diffusion trends across a large set of metal oxide compositions. These general trends are rationalized with the electronic charge localized at the lattice oxygen and can be utilized to predict the surface activity, the free energy of complex bulk metal oxides, and their oxygen conductivity.",

However, the latitude‐dependent mantle (LDM), a dust‐ice mantling deposit that is thought to represent a recent “Ice Age,” remains poorly explained by GCMs. We reexamine this question by considering the effect of radiatively active water‐ice clouds (RACs) and cloud microphysics. We find that when obliquity is set to 35°, as often occurred in the past 2 million years, warming of the atmosphere and polar caps by clouds modifies the water cycle and leads to the formation of a several centimeter‐thick ice mantle poleward of 30° in each hemisphere during winter. This mantle can be preserved over the summer if increased atmospheric dust content obscures the surface and provides dust nuclei to low‐altitude clouds. We outline a scenario for its deposition and preservation that compares favorably with the characteristics of the LDM.",

Global minimum searches reveal a dense potential energy landscape with 13 quasi-planar structures within 10 kcal/mol at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d) level of theory. Three quasi-planar isomers (I, II, and III) are lowest in energy and nearly degenerate at the CCSD(T) level of theory, with II and III being 0.8 and 0.9 kcal/mol higher, respectively, whereas at two density functional levels of theory isomer III is the lowest in energy (8.4 kcal/mol more stable than I at PBE0/6-311+G(2df) level). Comparison with experimental photoelectron spectroscopic data shows isomer II to be the major contributor while isomers I and III cannot be ruled out as minor contributors to the observed spectrum. Theoretical analyses reveal similar chemical bonding in I and II, both involving peripheral 2c-2e B−B σ-bonding and delocalized interior σ- and π-bonding. Isomer III has an interesting elongated ribbon-like structure with a π-bonding pattern analogous to those of dibenzopentalene. The high density of low-lying isomers indicates the complexity of the medium-sized boron clusters; the method dependency of predicting relative energies of the low-lying structures for B25− suggests the importance of comparison with experiment in determining the global minima of boron clusters at this size range. The appearance of many low-lying quasi-planar structures containing a hexagonal hole in B25− suggests the importance of this structural feature in maintaining planarity of larger boron clusters.",

Our approach is to vary tunable algorithmic settings, along with known algorithmic optimizations and two different memory layouts, and measure performance in terms of absolute runtime and L2 memory cache misses. Our results indicate there is a wide variation in runtime performance on all platforms, as much as 254% for the tunable parameters we test on multi-core CPUs and 265% on many-core GPUs, and the optimal configurations vary across platforms, often in a non-obvious way. For example, our results indicate the optimal configurations on the GPU occur at a crossover point between those that maintain good cache utilization and those that saturate computational throughput. This result is likely to be extremely difficult to predict with an empirical performance model for this particular algorithm because it has an unstructured memory access pattern that varies locally for individual rays and globally for the selected viewpoint. Our results also show that optimal parameters on modern architectures are markedly different from those in previous studies run on older architectures. In addition, given the dramatic performance variation across platforms for both optimal algorithm settings and performance results, there is a clear benefit for production visualization and analysis codes to adopt a strategy for performance optimization through auto-tuning. These benefits will likely become more pronounced in the future as the number of cores per chip and the cost of moving data through the memory hierarchy both increase.",

Low segment 7 entropy values from the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic suggests either that: (1) the viruses causing the current outbreak have convergently evolved to their low entropy state or (2) more likely, not enough time has yet passed for the entropy to accumulate. Because of its dependence upon the periodicity of the codon, the decimative procedure should be generalizable to any biological system.",

    "abstract": "Information entropy (H) is a measure of uncertainty at each position within in a sequence of nucleotides.H was used to characterize a set of influenza A segment 7 nucleotide sequences. Nucleotide locations of high entropy were identified near the 5’ start of all of the sequences and the sequences were assigned to subsets according to synonymous nucleotide variants at those positions: either uracil at position six (U6), cytosine at position six (C6), adenine (A12) at position 12, guanine at position 12 (G12), adenine at position 15 (A15) or cytosine (C15) at position 15. H values were found to be correlated/corresponding (Kendall tau) along the lengths of the nucleotide segments of the subset pairs at each position. However, the H values of each subset of sequences were statistically distinguishable from those of the other member of the pair (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). The joint probability of uncorrelated distributions of U6 and C6 sequences to viral subtypes and to viral host species was 34 times greater than for the A12:G12 subset pair and 214 times greater than for the A15:C15 pair. This result indicates that the high entropy position six of segment 7 is either a reporter or a sentinel location. The fact that not one of the H5N1 sequences in the dataset was a member of the C6 subset, but all 125 H5N1 sequences are members of the U6 subset suggests a non-random sentinel function.",

RNA-seq is a standard method measuring gene regulation using an established set of analysis stages. However, none of the currently available pipeline methods for interpreting ordered genomic data (in time or space) use time-series models to assign cause and effect relationships within GRNs, are adaptive to diverse experimental designs, or enable user interpretation through a web-based platform. Furthermore, methods integrating ordered RNA-seq data with protein–DNA binding data to distinguish direct from indirect interactions are urgently needed. We present TIMEOR (Trajectory Inference and Mechanism Exploration with Omics data in R), the first web-based and adaptive time-series multi-omics pipeline method which infers the relationship between gene regulatory events across time. TIMEOR addresses the critical need for methods to determine causal regulatory mechanism networks by leveraging time-series RNA-seq, motif analysis, protein–DNA binding data, and protein-protein interaction networks. TIMEOR’s user-catered approach helps non-coders generate new hypotheses and validate known mechanisms. We used TIMEOR to identify a novel link between insulin stimulation and the circadian rhythm cycle. TIMEOR is available at https://github.com/ashleymaeconard/TIMEOR.git and http://timeor.brown.edu.",

Previous work has suggested that helminthic infections can affect the intestinal microbiome, and we hypothesized thatS.haematobiuminfection could result in an alteration of immune system-microbiota homeostasis and impact the composition of the gut microbiota. To address this question, we compared the fecal microbiomes of infected and uninfected schoolchildren from the Argungu Local Government Area of Kebbi State, Nigeria, detecting significant differences in community composition between the two groups. Most remarkably, we observed a decreased abundance of Firmicutes and increased abundance of Proteobacteria – a shift in community structure which has been previously associated with dysbiosis. More specifically, we detected a number of changes in lower taxa reminiscent of inflammation-associated dysbiosis, including decreases in Clostridiales and increases in Moraxellaceae, Veillonellaceae, Pasteurellaceae, and Desulfovibrionaceae. Functional potential analysis also revealed an enrichment in orthologs of urease, which has been linked to dysbiosis and inflammation. Overall, our analysis indicates thatS.haematobiuminfection is associated with perturbations in the gut microbiota and may point to microbiome disruption as an additional consequence of schistosome infection.",

At sites with variable amounts of forested habitat, sympatric bat species may exhibit high dietary overlap, but mechanisms of coexistence are unknown. We analyzed the diets of sympatric Myotis septentrionalis and Myotis sodalis in two different landscapes in central Indiana, USA: a riparian agricultural site and a managed forest site, aiming to assess interspecific dietary overlap. We collected fecal samples from 166 Myotis over four maternity seasons and used DNA metabarcoding to assess niche overlap by operational taxonomic units (OTUs, n = 708) and prey‐size taxa (n = 79). Analyzing diets by prey‐size classes, as opposed to only species, provided an alternative interpretation of dietary richness and overlap that may more accurately represent predator perceptions of prey. With overall prey sizes ranging from 2–36 mm, M. septentrionalis (n = 88) consumed larger prey (10.0 ± 5.5 mm, μ ± σ) than M. sodalis (n = 78; 8.9 ± 5.0 mm). Myotis sodalis had a more diverse diet (547 OTUs) compared to M. septentrionalis (453 OTUs) despite the smaller sample size. Of the 708 OTUs detected, 41% (292) were common across bat species. We found greater dietary overlap between species within each site than within either species across sites, suggesting both species mostly consume whatever insects are available on the landscape. Flexible hunting strategies may allow these species to coexist by consuming different sizes of prey at different rates in the tradeoff between travel cost and profitability. Prey size is an important measure for dietary overlap and resource partitioning in bats that few studies have yet considered, with implications for linking predators, prey, and habitats.",

Model components (subsets of agents connected through partnerships in a sexual network but not sharing partnerships with any other agents) were first randomized to an intervention coverage level or the control group; then, within intervention components, eligible agents were randomized to receive or not receive PrEP. We calculated direct and disseminated (indirect) effects using randomization-based estimators and report corresponding 95% simulation intervals across scenarios ranging from 10% coverage in the intervention components to 90% coverage. A population of 11,245 agents was simulated, with an average of 1,551 components identified. When comparing agents randomized to no PrEP in 70% coverage components with control agents, there was a 15% disseminated risk reduction in HIV incidence (risk ratio = 0.85, 95% simulation interval: 0.65, 1.05).

In the Indo-Pacific Ocean, hydrothermal ecosystems are often dominated by gastropod species of the genus Alviniconcha, which live in association with chemosynthetic Gammaproteobacteria or Campylobacteria. While the symbiont genomes of most extant Alviniconcha species have been sequenced, no genome information is currently available for the gammaproteobacterial endosymbiont of Alviniconcha adamantis—a comparatively shallow living species that is thought to be the ancestor to all other present Alviniconcha lineages. Here, we report the first genome sequence for the symbiont of A. adamantis from the Chamorro Seamount at the Mariana Arc. Our phylogenomic analyses show that the A. adamantis symbiont is most closely related to Chromatiaceae endosymbionts of the hydrothermal vent snails Alviniconcha strummeri and Chrysomallon squamiferum, but represents a distinct bacterial species or possibly genus. Overall, the functional capacity of the A. adamantis symbiont appeared to be similar to other chemosynthetic Gammaproteobacteria, though several flagella and chemotaxis genes were detected, which are absent in other gammaproteobacterial Alviniconcha symbionts. These differences might suggest potential contrasts in symbiont transmission dynamics, host recognition, or nutrient transfer. Furthermore, an abundance of genes for ammonia transport and urea usage could indicate adaptations to the oligotrophic waters of the Mariana region, possibly via recycling of host- and environment-derived nitrogenous waste products. This genome assembly adds to the growing genomic resources for chemosynthetic bacteria from hydrothermal vents and will be valuable for future comparative genomic analyses assessing gene content evolution in relation to environment and symbiotic lifestyles.",

However, identifying optimal EES parameters presents a significant challenge due to the complex and stochastic nature of muscle control and the combinatorial explosion of possible parameter configurations. Here, we describe a machine-learning approach that leverages modern deep neural networks to learn bidirectional mappings between the space of permissible EES parameters and target motor outputs. Approach. We collected data from four sheep implanted with two 24-contact EES electrode arrays on the lumbosacral spinal cord. Muscle activity was recorded from four bilateral hindlimb electromyography (EMG) sensors. We introduce a general learning framework to identify EES parameters capable of generating desired patterns of EMG activity. Specifically, we first amortize spinal sensorimotor computations in a forward neural network model that learns to predict motor outputs based on EES parameters. Then, we employ a second neural network as an inverse model, which reuses the amortized knowledge learned by the forward model to guide the selection of EES parameters. Main results. We found that neural networks can functionally approximate spinal sensorimotor computations by accurately predicting EMG outputs based on EES parameters. The generalization capability of the forward model critically benefited our inverse model. We successfully identified novel EES parameters, in under 20 min, capable of producing desired target EMG recruitment during in vivo testing. Furthermore, we discovered potential functional redundancies within the spinal sensorimotor networks by identifying unique EES parameters that result in similar motor outcomes. Together, these results suggest that our framework is well-suited to probe spinal circuitry and control muscle recruitment in a completely data-driven manner. Significance. We successfully identify novel EES parameters within minutes, capable of producing desired EMG recruitment. Our approach is data-driven, subject-agnostic, automated, and orders of magnitude faster than manual approaches.",

We compare the bayescal calibration solutions to those recovered by calibrating the degenerate gain parameters with only the a priori known component of the calibration sky model both with and without imposing physically motivated priors on the gain amplitude solutions and for two choices of baseline length range over which to calibrate. We find that bayescal provides calibration solutions with up to 4 orders of magnitude lower power in spurious gain amplitude fluctuations than the calibration solutions derived for the same data set with the alternate approaches, and between ∼107 and ∼1010 times smaller than in the mean degenerate gain amplitude, on the full range of spectral scales accessible in the data. Additionally, we find that in the scenarios modelled only bayescal has sufficiently high fidelity calibration solutions for unbiased recovery of the 21-cm power spectrum on large spectral scales (k∥ ≲ 0.15 hMpc−1).

While its function in maintaining proper motor neuron function is well established, investigation into its role in the health and function of reproductive processes is only just beginning to be studied. Single-cell-sequencing analysis of all ovarian cells from the murine perinatal period revealed that Uchl1 is very highly expressed in the developing oocyte population, an observation which was corroborated by high levels of oocyte-enriched UCHL1 protein expression in oocytes of all stages throughout the mouse reproductive lifespan. To better understand the role UCHL1 may be playing in oocytes, we utilized a UCHL1-deficient mouse line, finding reduced number of litters, reduced litter sizes, altered folliculogenesis, morphologically abnormal oocytes, disrupted estrous cyclicity and apparent endocrine dysfunction in these animals compared to their wild-type and heterozygous littermates. These data reveal a novel role of UCHL1 in female fertility as well as overall ovarian function, and suggest a potentially essential role for the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in mediating reproductive health.",

The intrinsic discontinuous nature of the physical phenomena incurred by the presence of sharp phase boundaries makes the training of the surrogate model cumbersome. We develop a framework that integrates a convolutional autoencoder architecture with a deep neural operator (DeepONet) to learn the dynamic evolution of a two-phase mixture and accelerate time-to-solution in predicting the microstructure evolution. We utilize the convolutional autoencoder to provide a compact representation of the microstructure data in a low-dimensional latent space.

HO-1 can also enter the nucleus and regulate gene transcription independent of its enzymatic activity. Whether HO-1 can alter gene expression through direct binding to target DNA remains unclear. Here, we performed HO-1 CHIP-seq and then employed 3D structural modeling to reveal putative HO-1 DNA binding domains. We identified three probable DNA binding domains on HO-1. Using the Proteinarium, we identified several genes as the most highly connected nodes in the interactome among the HO-1 gene binding targets. We further demonstrated that HO-1 modulates the expression of these key genes using Hmox1 deficient cells. Finally, mutation of four conserved amino acids (E215, I211, E201, and Q27) within HO-1 DNA binding domain 1 significantly increased expression of Gtpbp3 and Eif1 genes that were identified within the top 10 binding hits normalized by gene length predicted to bind this domain. Based on these data, we conclude that HO-1 protein is a putative DNA binding protein, and regulates targeted gene expression. This provides the foundation for developing specific inhibitors or activators targeting HO-1 DNA binding domains to modulate targeted gene expression and corresponding cellular function.",

The role of the wake structure is particularly important for array deployments of oscillating foils since the unsteady wake highly influences the performance of downstream foils. This work explores 46 oscillating foil kinematics, with the goal of parameterizing the wake based on the input kinematic variables and grouping vortex wakes through image analysis of vorticity fields. A combination of a convolutional neural network with long short-term memory units is developed to classify the wakes into three classes. To fully verify the physical wake differences among foil kinematics, a convolutional autoencoder combined with [Formula: see text]-means++ clustering is used to reveal four wake patterns via an unsupervised method. Future work can use these patterns to predict the performance of foils placed in the wake and build optimal foil arrangements for tidal energy harvesting.",

The symposium was held in honor of Prof. Kim’s 70th Birthday and celebrated over 40 years of Prof. Kim’s independent research achievements across several areas of Applied Mechanics. The present paper is dedicated to Prof. Kim, a great colleague at Brown University.We present a new formulation for the multilayer isogeometric Kirchhoff–Love (KL) shells, where the individual layers are assumed to interact through no-penetration and frictional contact. This work is largely motivated by the experiments and analysis presented in Poincloux et al. (2021, “Bending Response of a Book With Internal Friction,” Phys. Rev. Lett., 126(21), p. 218004). We utilize a regularized version of Coulomb’s friction law to model the tangential traction between the contacting shell surfaces. To ensure objectivity (i.e., reference-frame invariance) in the frictional model, we propose two different strategies to extrapolate the velocity vectors of the contact pair at the contact interface: (i) using the underlying KL kinematics of the individual shell layers and (ii) using the Taylor series-based extension from Kamensky et al. (2019, “Peridynamic Modeling of Frictional Contact,” J. Peridyn. Nonlocal Model., 1(2), pp. 107–121). We compare the performance of both approaches through a numerical benchmark example. We then validate our multilayer shell formulation using the “bending response of a book with internal friction” experiments of Poincloux et al. (2021, “Bending Response of a Book With Internal Friction,” Phys. Rev. Lett., 126(21), p. 218004).",

GenBank is the largest collection of publicly available DNA sequences, which is maintained by the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The metadata of GenBank records are a largely understudied resource and may be uniquely leveraged to access the sum of prior studies focused on microbiome composition. Here, we developed a computational pipeline to analyze GenBank metadata, containing data on hosts, microorganisms and their place of origin. This work provides the first opportunity to leverage the totality of GenBank to shed light on compositional data practices that shape how microbiome datasets are formed as well as examine host–microbiome relationships.ResultsThe collected dataset contains multiple kingdoms of microorganisms, consisting of bacteria, viruses, archaea, protozoa, fungi, and invertebrate parasites, and hosts of multiple taxonomical classes, including mammals, birds and fish. A human data subset of this dataset provides insights to gaps in current microbiome data collection, which is biased towards clinically relevant pathogens. Clustering and phylogenic analysis reveals the potential to use these data to model host taxonomy and evolution, revealing groupings formed by host diet, environment and coevolution.Availability and implementationGenBank Host-Microbiome Pipeline is available at https://github.com/bcbi/genbank_holobiome.

We propose a framework for more effectively incorporating optimistic initialization into reinforcement learning for continuous control. Our approach uses metric information about the state-action space to estimate which transitions are still unexplored, and explicitly maintains the initial Q-value optimism for the corresponding state-action pairs. We also develop methods for efficiently approximating these training objectives, and for incorporating domain knowledge into the optimistic envelope to improve sample efficiency. We empirically evaluate these approaches on a variety of hard exploration problems in continuous control, where our method outperforms existing exploration techniques.",

Conventional approaches summarize within-host HIV diversity with a single consensus sequence per host of the pol gene, obtained from Sanger or next-generation sequencing (NGS). There is growing recognition that this approach discards potentially important information about within-host sequence variation, which can impact phylogenetic inference. However, whether alternative summary methods that incorporate intra-host variation impact phylogenetic inference of transmission network features is unknown.MethodsWe introduce profile sampling, a method to incorporate within-host NGS sequence diversity into phylogenetic HIV cluster inference. We compare this approach to Sanger- and NGS-derived pol and near-whole-genome consensus sequences and evaluate its potential benefits in identifying molecular clusters among all newly-HIV-diagnosed individuals over six months at the largest HIV center in Rhode Island.ResultsProfile sampling cluster inference demonstrated that within-host viral diversity impacts phylogenetic inference across individuals, and that consensus sequence approaches can obscure both magnitude and effect of these impacts. Clustering differed between Sanger- and NGS-derived consensus and profile sampling sequences, and across gene regions.DiscussionProfile sampling can incorporate within-host HIV diversity captured by NGS into phylogenetic analyses.

Currently, real-time data integration, analysis, and interpretation are challenging, leading to a delayed public health response. We present a comprehensive methodology for addressing these challenges through data integration, analysis, and reporting. We integrated heterogeneous data sources across systems and developed an open-source, automatic bioinformatics pipeline that provides molecular HIV cluster data to inform public health responses to new statewide HIV-1 diagnoses, overcoming data management, computational, and analytical challenges. We demonstrate implementation of this pipeline in a statewide HIV epidemic and use it to compare the impact of specific phylogenetic and distance-only methods and datasets on molecular HIV cluster analyses. The pipeline was applied to 18 monthly datasets generated between January 2020 and June 2022 in Rhode Island, USA, that provide statewide molecular HIV data to support routine public health case management by a multi-disciplinary team. The resulting cluster analyses and near-real-time reporting guided public health actions in 37 phylogenetically clustered cases out of 57 new HIV-1 diagnoses. Of the 37, only 21 (57%) clustered by distance-only methods. Through a unique academic-public health partnership, an automated open-source pipeline was developed and applied to prospective, routine analysis of statewide molecular HIV data in near-real-time.

While the hypothalamus is a well-conserved brain region that controls these homeostatic and survival-related behaviors, little is known about the intrinsic features of hypothalamic aging. Here, we perform single-nuclei RNA sequencing of 40,064 hypothalamic nuclei from young and aged female mice. We identify cell type-specific signatures of aging in neuronal subtypes as well as astrocytes and microglia. We uncover changes in cell types critical for metabolic regulation and body composition and in an area of the hypothalamus linked to cognition. Our analysis also reveals an unexpected female-specific feature of hypothalamic aging: the master regulator of X inactivation, Xist, is elevated with age, particularly in hypothalamic neurons. Moreover, using machine learning, we show that levels of X chromosome genes and Xist itself, can accurately predict cellular age. This study identifies critical cell-specific changes of the aging hypothalamus in mammals and uncovers a potential marker of neuronal aging in females.",

For example, our concept of “cat” is related to our concepts of “ears” and “whiskers” in a non-arbitrary way. Fodor (1998) proposes one theory of concepts, which emphasizes symbolic representations related via constituency structures. Whether neural networks are consistent with such a theory is open for debate. We propose unit tests for evaluating whether a system’s behavior is consistent with several key aspects of Fodor’s criteria. Using a simple visual concept learning task, we evaluate several modern neural architectures against this specification. We find that models succeed on tests of groundedness, modularity, and reusability of concepts, but that important questions about causality remain open. Resolving these will require new methods for analyzing models’ internal states.",

We identified 20 cell states across six developmental stages from 8 hpf to mid-gastrula stage, using the analysis of 25,703 cells. The clusters were assigned cell states based on known marker gene expression and by in situ RNA hybridization. We found that early (morula, 8-14 hpf) and late (blastula-to-mid-gastrula) cell states are transcriptionally distinct. Cells surrounding the blastopore undergo rapid cell state changes that include endomesoderm diversification. Of particular import to understanding germ cell specification is that we never see Nodal pathway members within Nanos/Vasa-positive cells in the region known to give rise to the primordial germ cells (PGCs). The results from this work contrast the results of PGC specification in the sea urchin, and the dataset presented here enables deeper comparative studies in tractable developmental models for testing a variety of developmental mechanisms.",

Gene ontology, protein network analysis, and chromatin mapping demonstrate that TAF4b is both a direct and indirect regulator of cell cycle-related gene expression programs during ProSpg quiescence.

Hence, fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to alleviate the cost in computationally taxing processes such as in optimization and design of materials. The intrinsic discontinuous nature of the physical phenomena incurred by the presence of sharp phase boundaries makes the training of the surrogate model cumbersome. We develop a framework that integrates a convolutional autoencoder architecture with a deep neural operator (DeepONet) to learn the dynamic evolution of a two-phase mixture. We utilize the convolutional autoencoder to provide a compact representation of the microstructure data in a low-dimensional latent space. DeepONet, which consists of two sub-networks, one for encoding the input function at a fixed number of sensors locations (branch net) and another for encoding the locations for the output functions (trunk net), learns the mesoscale dynamics of the microstructure evolution from the autoencoder latent space. The decoder part of the convolutional autoencoder then reconstructs the time-evolved microstructure from the DeepONet predictions. The result is an efficient and accurate accelerated phase-field framework that is robust to noisy inputs.",

Two expanded distribution implementation approaches were considered: one consistent with the current spatial distribution patterns for each distribution program type (supply-based approach) and one consistent with the current spatial distribution of individuals in each of the risk groups, assuming that programs could direct the additional kits to new geographic areas if required (demand-based approach).Main Outcomes and MeasuresWitnessed OODs, cost per OOD averted (efficiency), geospatial health inequality measured by the Theil index, and between-group variance for OOD rates.ResultsA total of 63 131 simulated individuals were estimated to be at risk for opioid overdose in Rhode Island based on current population data. With the supply-based approach, prioritizing additional naloxone kits to people who use illicit drugs averted more witnessed OODs by an estimated mean of 18.9% (95% simulation interval [SI], 13.1%-30.7%) annually. Expanded naloxone distribution using the demand-based approach and focusing on people who inject drugs had the best outcomes across all scenarios, averting an estimated mean of 25.3% (95% SI, 13.1%-37.6%) of witnessed OODs annually, at the lowest mean incremental cost of $27 312 per OOD averted. Other strategies were associated with fewer OODs averted at higher costs but showed similar patterns of improved outcomes and lower unit costs if kits could be reallocated to areas with greater need. The demand-based approach reduced geospatial inequality in OOD rates in all scenarios compared with the supply-based approach and status quo.Conclusions and RelevanceIn this decision analytical model study, variations in the effectiveness, efficiency, and health inequality of the different naloxone distribution expansion strategies and approaches were identified. Future efforts should be prioritized for people at highest risk for overdose (those who inject drugs or use illicit drugs) and redirected toward areas with the greatest need. These findings may inform future naloxone distribution priority settings.",

    "abstract": "Focal epileptic seizures can remain localized or, alternatively, spread across brain areas, often resulting in impairment of cognitive function and loss of consciousness. Understanding the factors that promote spread is important for developing better therapeutic approaches. Here, we show that: (1) seizure spread undergoes “critical” phase transitions in models (epileptor-networks) that capture the neural dynamics of spontaneous seizures while incorporating patient-specific brain network connectivity, axonal delays and identified epileptogenic zones (EZs). We define a collective variable for the spreading dynamics as the spread size, i.e. the number of areas or nodes in the network to which a seizure has spread. Global connectivity strength and excitability in the surrounding non-epileptic areas work as phase-transition control parameters for this collective variable. (2) Phase diagrams are predicted by stability analysis of the network dynamics. (3) In addition, the components of the Jacobian’s leading eigenvector, which tend to reflect the connectivity strength and path lengths from the EZ to surrounding areas, predict the temporal order of network-node recruitment into seizure. (4) However, stochastic fluctuations in spread size in a near-criticality region make predictability more challenging. Overall, our findings support the view that within-patient seizure-spread variability can be characterized by phase-transition dynamics under transient variations in network connectivity strength and excitability across brain areas. Furthermore, they point to the potential use and limitations of model-based prediction of seizure spread in closed-loop interventions for seizure control.",

We sought to determine if the genetic architecture of preeclampsia can be described by clusters of patients with variants in genes in shared protein interaction networks. We performed a case-control study using whole exome sequencing on early onset preeclamptic mothers with severe clinical features and control mothers with uncomplicated pregnancies between 2016 and 2020. A total of 143 patients were enrolled, 61 women with early onset preeclampsia with severe features based on ACOG criteria, and 82 control women at term, matched for race and ethnicity. A network analysis and visualization tool, Proteinarium, was used to confirm there are clusters of patients with shared gene networks associated with severe preeclampsia. The majority of the sequenced patients appear in two significant clusters. We identified one case dominant and one control dominant cluster. Thirteen genes were unique to the case dominated cluster. Among these genes, LAMB2, PTK2, RAC1, QSOX1, FN1, and VCAM1 have known associations with the pathogenic mechanisms of preeclampsia. Using bioinformatic analysis, we were able to identify subsets of patients with shared protein interaction networks, thus confirming our hypothesis about the genetic architecture of preeclampsia.",

However, at low frequencies, foregrounds are likely to become optically thick, which would make it completely impossible to see a 21 cm signal behind them. To find out which regions of the sky might be optically thick for the highest redshifts of the 21 cm signal, we fit the measurements from LWA1 and the Haslam 408 MHz map with a two-component spectral model and calculate the frequency-dependent foreground optical depth point-by-point across the sky. Limitations of the current data prevent us from making any strong conclusions at high statistical significance, but there is suggestive evidence (∼1σ) that as much as 25 per cent of the sky could be obscured for the highest redshift 21 cm signals.",

In this work, we address this problem and discover new limits on the histopathological tasks for which deep learning models learn trustworthy versus deceptive solutions.

Previously, mice lacking TBP-associated factor 4b (Taf4b) were shown to exhibit a diminished ovarian reserve. However, potential oocyte-intrinsic functions of TAF4b have not been examined. Here, we use a combination of gene expression profiling and chromatin mapping to characterize TAF4b-dependent gene regulatory networks in mouse oocytes. We find that Taf4b-deficient oocytes display inappropriate expression of meiotic, chromatin modification/organization, and X-linked genes. Furthermore, dysregulated genes in Taf4b-deficient oocytes exhibit an unexpected amount of overlap with dysregulated genes in oocytes from XO female mice, a mouse model of Turner Syndrome. Using Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&amp;RUN), we observed TAF4b enrichment at genes involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair, some of which are differentially expressed in Taf4b-deficient oocytes. Interestingly, TAF4b target genes were enriched for Sp/Klf family and NFY target motifs rather than TATA-box motifs, suggesting an alternative mode of promoter interaction. Together, our data connect several gene regulatory nodes that contribute to the precise development of the mammalian ovarian reserve.",

While behavior can be imaged efficiently, the quantification of specific aspects of behavior is labor-intensive and may introduce individual biases. Recent advances in deep learning and artificial intelligence-based tools have made it possible to precisely track individual features of freely moving animals in diverse environments without any markers. In the current study, we developed Zebrafish Larvae Position Tracker (Z-LaP Tracker), a modification of the markerless position estimation software DeepLabCut, to quantify zebrafish larval behavior in a high-throughput 384-well setting. We utilized the high-contrast features of our model animal, zebrafish larvae, including the eyes and the yolk for our behavioral analysis. Using this experimental setup, we quantified relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to the analysis performed by humans. The changes in behavior were organized in behavioral profiles, which were examined by K-means and hierarchical cluster analysis. Calcineurin inhibitors exhibited a distinct behavioral profile characterized by increased activity, acoustic hyperexcitability, reduced visually guided behaviors, and reduced habituation to acoustic stimuli. The developed methodologies were used to identify ‘CsA-type’ drugs that might be promising candidates for the prevention and treatment of neurological disorders.",

In this study, we present an algorithm for PINNs applied to the acoustic wave equation and test the method with both forward models and FWI case studies. These synthetic case studies are designed to explore the ability of PINNs to handle varying degrees of structural complexity using both teleseismic plane waves and seismic point sources. PINNs' meshless formalism allows for a flexible implementation of the wave equation and different types of boundary conditions. For instance, our models demonstrate that PINN automatically satisfies absorbing boundary conditions, a serious computational challenge for common wave propagation solvers. Furthermore, a priori knowledge of the subsurface structure can be seamlessly encoded in PINNs' formulation. We find that the current state‐of‐the‐art PINNs provide good results for the forward model, even though spectral element or finite difference methods are more efficient and accurate. More importantly, our results demonstrate that PINNs yield excellent results for inversions on all cases considered and with limited computational complexity. We discuss the current limitations of the method with complex velocity models as well as strategies to overcome these challenges. Using PINNs as a geophysical inversion solver offers exciting perspectives, not only for the full waveform seismic inversions, but also when dealing with other geophysical datasets (e.g., MT, gravity) as well as joint inversions because of its robust framework and simple implementation.",

To account for covariance between the 21 cm signal and contaminating foreground emission, bayeseor jointly constructs models for both signals within a Bayesian framework. Due to computational constraints, the forward model is constructed using a restricted field of view (FoV) in the image domain. When the only Epoch of Reionization contaminants are noise and foregrounds, we demonstrate that bayeseor can accurately recover the 21 cm power spectrum when the component of sky emission outside this forward-modelled region is downweighted by the beam at the level of the dynamic range between the foreground and 21 cm signals. However, when all-sky foreground emission is included along with a realistic instrument primary beam with sidelobes above this threshold extending to the horizon, the recovered power spectrum is contaminated by unmodelled sky emission outside the restricted FoV model. Expanding the combined cosmological and foreground model to cover the whole sky is computationally prohibitive. To address this, we present a modified version of bayeseor that allows for an all-sky foreground model, while the modelled 21 cm signal remains only within the primary FoV of the telescope. With this modification, it will be feasible to run an all-sky bayeseor analysis on a sizeable compute cluster. We also discuss several future directions for further reducing the need to model all-sky foregrounds, including wide-field foreground subtraction, an image-domain likelihood utilizing a tapering function, and instrument primary beam design.",

Human granulosa cells (GCs) are the functional unit of the ovarian follicle with steroidogenic and signaling activities, and play a pivotal role in oocyte development. During follicle progression, GCs multiply to form a 3D avascular structure, and establish gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) that is critical to maintaining optimal viability and function. We developed a high-throughput in vitro platform of human GCs for the screening of chemicals that can impact GJIC and estradiol (E2) production of human granulosa. Our granulosa 3D microtissues fabricated with human ovarian granulosa-like tumor KGN cells are multicell-layered structures that mimic the avascular granulosa layers surrounding the oocyte. These microtissues robustly expressed the steroidogenic CYP19 aromatase enzyme and GJIC intercellular membrane channel, connexin 43. Granulosa microtissues produced E2 at rates comparable to primary human GCs as previously reported. E2 production was suppressed by the CYP19 inhibitor, letrozole, and induced by CYP19 activators, bisphenol A at 100 µM, and genistein at 100 µM. Granulosa microtissues displayed active GJIC function, as demonstrated by the connexin 43-dependent diffusion of calcein fluorescent dye from microtissue surface to the core using high-throughput confocal microscopy in conjunction with our open-sourced automated image analysis tool. Overall, our 3D human granulosa screening platform is highly promising for predictive and efficient in vitro toxicity testing to screen for chemicals that contaminate follicular fluid and may affect fertility.",

The high lethality rate associated with these pathologies outlines the importance of clarifying the “priming” effects seen in the post-shock lung microenvironment, which are understood to bring about a dysregulated or overt immune response when triggered by a secondary systemic infectious/septic challenge culminating in ALI. In this pilot project, we test the hypothesis that application of a single cell multiomics approach can elucidate novel phenotype specific pathways potentially contributing to shock-induced ALI/ARDS.MethodsHypovolemic shock was induced in C57BL/6 (wild-type), PD-1, PD-L1, or VISTA gene deficient male mice, 8–12 weeks old. Wild-type sham surgeries function as negative controls. A total of 24-h post-shock rodents were sacrificed, their lungs harvested and sectioned, with pools prepared from 2 mice per background, and flash frozen on liquid nitrogen. N = 2 biological replicates (representing 4 mice total) were achieved for all treatment groups across genetic backgrounds. Samples were received by the Boas Center for Genomics and Human Genetics, where single cell multiomics libraries were prepared for RNA/ATAC sequencing. The analysis pipeline Cell Ranger ARC was implemented to attain feature linkage assessments across genes of interest.ResultsSham (pre-shock) results suggest high chromatin accessibility around calcitonin receptor like receptor (CALCRL) across cellular phenotypes with 17 and 18 feature links, exhibiting positive correlation with gene expression between biological replicates. Similarity between both sample chromatin profiles/linkage arcs is evident. Post-shock wild-type accessibility is starkly reduced across replicates where the number of feature links drops to 1 and 3, again presenting similar replicate profiles. Samples from shocked gene deficient backgrounds displayed high accessibility and similar profiles to the pre-shock lung microenvironment.ConclusionHigh pre-shock availability of DNA segments and their positive correlation with CALCRL gene expression suggests an apparent regulatory capacity on transcription. Post-shock gene deficient chromatin profiles presented similar results to that of pre-shock wild-type samples, suggesting an influence on CALCRL accessibility. Key changes illustrated in the pre-ALI context of shock may allow for additional resolution of “priming” and “cellular pre-activation/pre-disposition” processes within the lung microenvironment.",

On longer time scale, however, recent studies of deep‐sea carbonate sediments suggest significantly increased carbonate production and burial in the open ocean during the warm Middle Miocene. Here, we present new model simulations in comparison to published Miocene carbonate accumulation rates to show that global biogenic carbonate production in the pelagic environment was approximately doubled relative to present‐day values when elevated atmospheric pCO2 led to substantial global warming ∼13–15 million years ago. Our analysis also finds that although high carbonate production was associated with high dissolution in the deep‐sea, net pelagic carbonate burial was approximately 30%–45% higher than modern. At the steady state of the long‐term carbon cycle, this requires an equivalent increase in riverine carbonate alkalinity influx during the Middle Miocene, attributable to enhanced chemical weathering under a warmer climate. Elevated biogenic carbonate production resulted in a Miocene ocean that had carbon (dissolved inorganic carbon) and alkalinity (total alkalinity) inventories similar to modern values but was poorly buffered and less saturated in both the surface and the deep ocean relative to modern.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBeing the largest lymphatic organ in the body, the spleen also constantly controls the quality of red blood cells (RBCs) in circulation through its two major filtration components, namely interendothelial slits (IES) and red pulp macrophages. In contrast to the extensive studies in understanding the filtration function of IES, there are relatively fewer works on investigating how the splenic macrophages retain the aged and diseased RBCs, i.e., RBCs in sickle cell disease (SCD). Herein, we perform a computational study informed by companion experiments to quantify the dynamics of RBCs captured and retained by the macrophages. We first calibrate the parameters in the computational model based on microfluidic experimental measurements for sickle RBCs under normoxia and hypoxia, as those parameters are not available in the literature. Next, we quantify the impact of a set of key factors that are expected to dictate the RBC retention by the macrophages in the spleen, namely, blood flow conditions, RBC aggregation, hematocrit, RBC morphology, and oxygen levels. Our simulation results show that hypoxic conditions could enhance the adhesion between the sickle RBCs and macrophages. This, in turn, increases the retention of RBCs by as much as five-fold, which could be a possible cause of RBC congestion in the spleen of patients with SCD. Our study on the impact of RBC aggregation illustrates a ‘clustering effect’, where multiple RBCs in one aggregate can make contact and adhere to the macrophages, leading to a higher retention rate than that resulting from RBC-macrophage pair interactions. Our simulations of sickle RBCs flowing past macrophages for a range of blood flow velocities indicate that the increased blood velocity could quickly attenuate the function of the red pulp macrophages on detaining aged or diseased RBCs, thereby providing a possible rationale for the slow blood flow in the open circulation of the spleen. Furthermore, we quantify the impact of RBC morphology on their tendency to be retained by the macrophages. We find that the sickle and granular-shaped RBCs are more likely to be filtered by macrophages in the spleen. This finding is consistent with the observation of low percentages of these two forms of sickle RBCs in the blood smear of SCD patients. Taken together, our experimental and simulation results aid in our quantitative understanding of the function of splenic macrophages in retaining the diseased RBCs and provide an opportunity to combine such knowledge with the current knowledge of the interaction between IES and traversing RBCs to apprehend the complete filtration function of the spleen in SCD.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDiatoms are among the most abundant phytoplankton that inhabit coastal ecosystems, forming large blooms that fuel coastal food webs. Although diatoms are often large and morphologically distinct, many are small or morphologically cryptic making it difficult to understand the temporal dynamics of whole diatom communities and the environmental factors that drive them. Here, we investigated diatom diversity and its environmental correlates using 6 yr of monthly surface water samples from the Narragansett Bay Plankton Time Series to investigate the seasonal and annual variability of diatom species occurrence. High‐throughput amplicon sequencing of filtered biomass yielded 658 diatom amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), of which 347 were identified to species. Of the 49 diatom genera in the sequencing dataset, 33% had never been observed in the time series using microscopy (1959–2014). We observed a weak quadratic relationship between ASV richness and chlorophyll‐a concentrations, suggesting that richness decreases during blooms. There was a significant difference in diatom ASV richness by season and we identified distinct assemblages associated with different seasons. These assemblages were remarkably synchronous, exhibiting a sinewave‐like pattern, over 6 yr with an annual periodicity that correlated significantly with seasonal changes in temperature, light, and dissolved inorganic nitrogen. The annual cycle of diatom assemblages suggests stability in a key component of the estuarine food web known to influence ecosystem resilience and function. Deviations from the annual cycle of recurrence could be used to distinguish between changes in community structure driven by annual fluctuations in the environment and those driven by climate‐change stressors.",

    "abstract": "We present Q-functionals, an alternative architecture for continuous control deep reinforcement learning. Instead of returning a single value for a state-action pair, our network transforms a state into a function that can be rapidly evaluated in parallel for many actions, allowing us to efficiently choose high-value actions through sampling. This contrasts with the typical architecture of off-policy continuous control, where a policy network is trained for the sole purpose of selecting actions from the Q-function. We represent our action-dependent Q-function as a weighted sum of basis functions (Fourier, Polynomial, etc) over the action space, where the weights are state-dependent and output by the Q-functional network. Fast sampling makes practical a variety of techniques that require Monte-Carlo integration over Q-functions, and enables action-selection strategies besides simple value-maximization. We characterize our framework, describe various implementations of Q-functionals, and demonstrate strong performance on a suite of continuous control tasks.",

In predator–prey interactions that involve an active chase, pursuit behaviour can be studied as the collection of rules that dictate how a predator should steer to capture prey. It remains unclear how variable this behaviour is within and across species since most studies have detailed the pursuit behaviour of high-speed, open-area foragers.

    "abstract": "Monitoring sequential information is an essential component of our daily lives. Many of these sequences are abstract, in that they do not depend on the individual stimuli, but do depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking). Despite the ubiquity and utility of abstract sequential monitoring, little is known about its neural mechanisms. Human rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) exhibits specific increases in neural activity (i.e., “ramping”) during abstract sequences. Monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been shown to represent sequential information in motor (not abstract) sequence tasks, and contains a subregion, area 46, with homologous functional connectivity to human RLPFC. To test the prediction that area 46 may represent abstract sequence information, and do so with parallel dynamics to those found in humans, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in three male monkeys. When monkeys performed no-report abstract sequence viewing, we found that left and right area 46 responded to abstract sequential changes. Interestingly, responses to rule and number changes overlapped in right area 46 and left area 46 exhibited responses to abstract sequence rules with changes in ramping activation, similar to that observed in humans. Together, these results indicate that monkey DLPFC monitors abstract visual sequential information, potentially with a preference for different dynamics in the two hemispheres. More generally, these results show that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTDaily, we complete sequences that are “abstract” because they depend on an ordered set of rules (e.g., chop then stir when cooking) rather than the identity of individual items. Little is known about how the brain tracks, or monitors, this abstract sequential information. Based on previous human work showing abstract sequence related dynamics in an analogous area, we tested whether monkey dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), specifically area 46, represents abstract sequential information using awake monkey functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We found that area 46 responded to abstract sequence changes, with a preference for more general responses on the right and dynamics similar to humans on the left. These results suggest that abstract sequences are represented in functionally homologous regions across monkeys and humans.",

As a result, out-of-distribution or adversarial input is often challenging for ANNs. Humans instead learn abstract patterns and are mostly unaffected by many extreme image distortions. We introduce a set of novel image transforms inspired by neurophysiological findings and evaluate humans and ANNs on an object recognition task. We show that machines perform better than humans for certain transforms and struggle to perform at par with humans on others that are easy for humans. We quantify the differences in accuracy for humans and machines and find a ranking of difficulty for our transforms for human data. We also suggest how certain characteristics of human visual processing can be adapted to improve the performance of ANNs for our difficult-for-machines transforms.",

    "abstract": "The spread of seizures across brain networks is the main impairing factor, often leading to loss-of-consciousness, in people with epilepsy. Despite advances in recording and modeling brain activity, uncovering the nature of seizure spreading dynamics remains an important challenge to understanding and treating pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. To address this challenge, we introduce a new probabilistic model that captures the spreading dynamics in patient-specific complex networks. Network connectivity and interaction time delays between brain areas were estimated from white-matter tractography. The model’s computational tractability allows it to play an important complementary role to more detailed models of seizure dynamics. We illustrate model fitting and predictive performance in the context of patient-specific Epileptor networks. We derive the phase diagram of spread size (order parameter) as a function of brain excitability and global connectivity strength, for different patient-specific networks. Phase diagrams allow the prediction of whether a seizure will spread depending on excitability and connectivity strength. In addition, model simulations predict the temporal order of seizure spread across network nodes. Furthermore, we show that the order parameter can exhibit both discontinuous and continuous (critical) phase transitions as neural excitability and connectivity strength are varied. Existence of a critical point, where response functions and fluctuations in spread size show power-law divergence with respect to control parameters, is supported by mean-field approximations and finite-size scaling analyses. Notably, the critical point separates two distinct regimes of spreading dynamics characterized by unimodal and bimodal spread-size distributions. Our study sheds new light on the nature of phase transitions and fluctuations in seizure spreading dynamics. We expect it to play an important role in the development of closed-loop stimulation approaches for preventing seizure spread in pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. Our findings may also be of interest to related models of spreading dynamics in epidemiology, biology, finance, and statistical physics.",

Our limits on the 21 cm power spectrum amplitude span a range in k space of $|k| \\lt 1 \\, h_{100}\\, {\\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ with a lowest measurement of Δ2(k) ≤ 4.58 × 103 mK2 at $k = 0.190\\, h_{100}\\, \\rm {Mpc}^{-1}$ and z = 7.14. In order to achieve these limits, we need to mitigate a previously unidentified common mode systematic in the data set. If not accounted for, this systematic introduces an overall negative bias that can make foreground contaminated measurements appear as stringent, noise-limited constraints on the 21 cm signal amplitude. The identification of this systematic highlights the risk in modelling systematics as positive-definite contributions to the power spectrum and in ‘conservatively’ interpreting all measurements as upper limits.",

We demonstrate the utility ofMultiovizby conducting an end-to-end analysis in a statistical genetics application focused on measuring the effect ofin silicoperturbations of complex trait architecture. By using a real data set from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, we both recapitulate previous findings and propose hypotheses about the genes involved in the percentage of immune CD8+ cells found in heterogeneous stocks of mice.

    "abstract": "Introduction: Research has shown epigenetic change via alternation of the methylation profile of human skeletal muscle DNA after Cardio-Pulmonary Bypass (CPB). In this study, we investigated the change in epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles of porcine myocardium after ischemic insult in the setting of treatment with extracellular vesicle (EV) therapy in normal vs. high-fat diet (HFD) pigs.  Methods: Four groups of three pigs underwent ameroid constrictor placement to the left circumflex artery (LCx) and were assigned to the following groups: (1) normal diet saline injection; (2) normal diet EV injection; (3) HFD saline injection; and (4) HFD EV injection. DNA methylation was profiled via reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and compared using a custom bioinformatic pipeline.  Results: After initial analysis, 441 loci had a nominal P value &lt; 0.05 when examining the effect of ischemia vs. normal heart tissue on a normal diet in the absence of treatment. 426 loci at P value threshold &lt; 0.05 were identified when comparing the ischemic vs. normal tissue from high-fat diet animals. When examining the effect of EV treatment in ischemic tissue in subjects on a normal diet, there were 574 loci with nominal P value &lt; 0.05 with two loci Fructosamine 3 kinase related protein [(FN3KRP) (P &lt; 0.001)] and SNTG1 (P = 0.03) significant after Bonferroni correction. When examining the effect of EV treatment in ischemic tissue in HFD, there were 511 loci with nominal P values &lt; 0.05. After Bonferroni correction, two loci had P values less than 0.05, betacellulin [(BTC) (P = 0.008)] and [proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7 (PCSK7) (P = 0.01)].  Conclusions: Alterations in DNA methylation were identified in pig myocardium after ischemic insult, change in diet, and treatment with EVs. Hundreds of differentially methylated loci were detected, but the magnitude of the effects was low. These changes represent significant alterations in DNA methylation and merit further investigation.",

While these spermatogenic precursor cells undergo the characteristic transitions of cycling and quiescence, the transcriptional events underlying these developmental hallmarks remain unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of TBP-associated factor 4b (Taf4b) in the timely development of quiescent mouse ProSpg using an integration of gene expression profiling and chromatin mapping. We find that Taf4b mRNA expression is elevated during the transition of mitotic-to-quiescent ProSpg and Taf4b-deficient ProSpg are delayed in their entry into quiescence. Gene ontology, protein network analysis, and chromatin mapping demonstrate that TAF4b is a direct and indirect regulator of chromatin and cell cycle-related gene expression programs during ProSpg quiescence. Further validation of these cell cycle mRNA changes due to the loss of TAF4b was accomplished via immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Together, these data indicate that TAF4b is a key transcriptional regulator of the chromatin and quiescent state of the developing mammalian spermatogenic precursor lineage.",

CS presents with developmental delay, seizures, intellectual disability, nonverbal status, postnatal microcephaly, and ataxia. To define transcriptome signatures of NHE6 LoF, we conducted in-depth RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on a haploid NHE6 null cell model. CRIPSR/Cas9 genome editing introduced multiple LoF mutations into SLC9A6 in the near haploid human cell line Hap1. Isogenic, paired parental controls were also studied. NHE6 mutant cell lines were confirmed to have intra-endosomal over-acidification as was seen in other NHE6 null cells. RNA-seq analysis was performed by two widely used pipelines: HISAT2-StringTie-DEseq2 and STAR-HTseq-DEseq2. We identified 1056 differentially expressed genes in mutant NHE6 lines, including genes associated with neurodevelopment, synapse function, voltage-dependent calcium channels, and neuronal signaling. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was then applied and identified a critical module enriched for genes governing lysosome function. By identifying significantly changed gene expression that is associated with lysosomal mechanisms in NHE6-null cells, our analyses suggest that loss of NHE6 function may converge on mechanisms implicated in lysosome-related neurologic disease. Further, this haploid cell model will serve as an important tool for translational science in CS.",

While AlphaFold 2 has shown exceptional accuracy and speed, it is designed to predict proteins' single ground state conformations and is limited in its ability to predict fold switching and the effects of mutations on conformational landscapes. Here, we demonstrate how AlphaFold 2 can directly predict the relative populations of different conformations of proteins and even accurately predict changes in those populations induced by mutations by subsampling multiple sequence alignments. We tested our method against NMR experiments on two proteins with drastically different amounts of available sequence data, Abl1 kinase and the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and predicted their relative state populations with accuracies in excess of 80%. Our method offers a fast and cost-effective way to predict protein conformations and their relative populations at even single point mutation resolution, making it a useful tool for pharmacology, analyzing NMR data, and studying the effects of evolution.",

    "abstract": "AbstractDifferent cell types aggregate and sort into hierarchical architectures during the formation of animal tissues. The resulting spatial organization depends (in part) on the strength of adhesion of one cell type to itself relative to other cell types. However, automated and unsupervised classification of these multicellular spatial patterns remains challenging, particularly given their structural diversity and biological variability. Recent developments based on topological data analysis are intriguing to reveal similarities in tissue architecture, but these methods remain computationally expensive. In this article, we show that multicellular patterns organized from two interacting cell types can be efficiently represented through persistence images. Our optimized combination of dimensionality reduction via autoencoders, combined with hierarchical clustering, achieved high classification accuracy for simulations with constant cell numbers. We further demonstrate that persistence images can be normalized to improve classification for simulations with varying cell numbers due to proliferation. Finally, we systematically consider the importance of incorporating different topological features as well as information about each cell type to improve classification accuracy. We envision that topological machine learning based on persistence images will enable versatile and robust classification of complex tissue architectures that occur in development and disease.",

The present study, inspired by comparable work in infants, aimed to categorize the items available to be gazed at by dogs during a common event in their daily life, a walk. We then explored the statistics over the availability of those categories and over the dogs’ visual attention. Using a head-mounted eye-tracking apparatus that was custom designed for dogs, 11 dogs walked on a pre-determined route outdoors under naturalistic conditions generating a total of 11,698 gazes for analysis. Image stills from these fixations were then analyzed using computer vision techniques to explore the items present, and how much space within the visual field those items occupied, and which of the items the dog was gazing at. On average, there were few individual differences between dogs both in the items in dogs’ field of view and their gaze to items. Dogs looked proportionally most at people, buses, plants, the pavement, and construction equipment. The results of this project provide a foundational step towards understanding how dogs look at and interact with their physical world, opening up avenues for future research into how they complete tasks, and learn and make decisions, both independently and with a human social partner.",

We propose that the host diet can modulate the chemical environment of the gut resulting in changes to the structure and function of the microbiome during antibiotic treatment. Gut dysbiosis is typically characterized by increases in aerobic respiratory bacterial metabolism, redox potential, and abundance of Proteobacteria. In this study, we explore dietary fiber supplements as potential modulators of the chemical environment in the gut to reduce this pattern of dysbiosis. Using defined-diets and whole-genome sequencing of female murine microbiomes during diet modulation and antibiotic treatment, we find that fiber prebiotics significantly reduced the impact of antibiotic treatment on microbiome composition and function. We observe reduced abundance of aerobic bacteria as well as metabolic pathways associated with oxidative metabolism. These metatranscriptomic results are corroborated by chemical measurements of eH and pH suggesting that fiber dampens the dysbiotic effects of antibiotics. This work indicates that fiber may act as a potential therapeutic for AID by modulating bacterial metabolism in the gut to prevent an increase in redox potential and protect commensal microbes during antibiotic treatment.",

The diversity and composition of diatoms in eutrophic nearshore habitats have been well documented due to the outsized influence of diatoms on coastal ecosystem functioning. In contrast, patterns of both diatom diversity and community composition in offshore oligotrophic regions where diatom biomass is low have been poorly resolved. To compare the diatom diversity and community composition in oligotrophic and eutrophic waters, diatom communities were sampled along a 1,250 km transect from the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea to the coastal waters of the northeast US shelf. Diatom community composition was determined by amplifying and sequencing the 18S rDNA V4 region. Of the 301 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) identified along the transect, the majority (70%) were sampled exclusively from oligotrophic waters of the Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea and included the genera Bacteriastrum, Haslea, Hemiaulus, Pseudo‐nitzschia, and Nitzschia. Diatom ASV richness did not vary along the transect, indicating that the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea and Gulf Stream are occupied by a diverse diatom community. Although ASV richness was similar between oligotrophic and coastal waters, diatom community composition in these regions differed significantly and was correlated with temperature and phosphate, two environmental variables known to influence diatom metabolism and geographic distribution. In sum, oligotrophic waters of the western North Atlantic harbor diverse diatom assemblages that are distinct from coastal regions, and these open ocean diatoms warrant additional study, as they may play critical roles in oligotrophic ecosystems.",

Drug challenge with d-amphetamine (AMP; 20 mg oral), methamphetamine (MA; Desoxyn®, 20 mg oral), and placebo (PBO) was conducted on three separate test days in a within-subjects double blind design.  Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) quantified neurometabolites in the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) 140-150 m post-drug and PBO. Subjective states were assessed at half hour intervals over 5.5-hours on each session, yielding 3,792 responses per participant (91,008 responses overall, N=24 participants).  Self-reports were reduced by principal components analysis to a single factor score of AMP- and MA-induced Positive Agency (△PA) in each participant.

While the effects of Neanderthal ancestry on human fitness and health have been explored more thoroughly, there are fewer examples of adaptive introgression of Denisovan variants. Here, we study the geneMUC19, for which some modern humans carry aDenisovan-likehaplotype.MUC19is a mucin, a glycoprotein that forms gels with various biological functions, from lubrication to immunity. We find the diagnostic variants for theDenisovan-like MUC19haplotype at high frequencies in admixed Latin American individuals among global population, and at highest frequency in 23 ancient Indigenous American individuals, all predating population admixture with Europeans and Africans. We find that some Neanderthals––Vindija and Chagyrskaya––carry theDenisovan-like MUC19haplotype, and that it was likely introgressed into human populations through Neanderthal introgression rather than Denisovan introgression. Finally, we find that theDenisovan-like MUC19haplotype carries a higher copy number of a 30 base-pair variable number tandem repeat relative to theHuman-likehaplotype, and that copy numbers of this repeat are exceedingly high in American populations. Our results suggest that theDenisovan-like MUC19haplotype served as the raw genetic material for positive selection as American populations adapted to novel environments during their movement from Beringia into North and then South America.",

In mice (&lt;12 h old) exposed to hyperoxia during the saccular stage followed by air recovery until adulthood, lung senescence increased particularly in type II cells and secondary crest myofibroblasts. This peaked during the alveolar stage and was mediated by the p53/p21 pathway. Decreasing senescent cells during the alveolar stage attenuated hyperoxia-induced alveolar and vascular simplification. Conclusively, early programmed senescence orchestrates postnatal lung development whereas later hyperoxia-induced senescence causes lung injury through different mechanisms. This defines the ontogeny of lung senescence and provides an optimal therapeutic window for mitigating neonatal hyperoxic lung injury by inhibiting senescence.",

    "abstract": "Fractional derivatives are nonlocal differential operators of real order that often appear in models of anomalous diffusion and a variety of nonlocal phenomena. Recently, a version of the Schrödinger Equation containing a fractional Laplacian has been proposed. In this work, we develop a Fractional Path Integral Monte Carlo algorithm that can be used to study the finite temperature behavior of the time-independent Fractional Schrödinger Equation for a variety of potentials. In so doing, we derive an analytic form for the finite temperature fractional free particle density matrix and demonstrate how it can be sampled to acquire new sets of particle positions. We employ this algorithm to simulate both the free particle and $^{4}$He (Aziz) Hamiltonians. We find that the fractional Laplacian strongly encourages particle delocalization, even in the presence of interactions, suggesting that fractional Hamiltonians may manifest atypical forms of condensation. Our work opens the door to studying fractional Hamiltonians with arbitrarily complex potentials that escape analytical solutions.",

    "abstract": "Rapid categorization paradigms have a long history in experimental psychology: Characterized by short presentation times and speedy behavioral responses, these tasks highlight the efficiency with which our visual system processes natural object categories. Previous studies have shown that feed-forward hierarchical models of the visual cortex provide a good fit to human visual decisions. At the same time, recent work in computer vision has demonstrated significant gains in object recognition accuracy with increasingly deep hierarchical architectures. But it is unclear how well these models account for human visual decisions and what they may reveal about the underlying brain processes. We have conducted a large-scale psychophysics study to assess the correlation between computational models and human participants on a rapid animal vs. non-animal categorization task. We considered visual representations of varying complexity by analyzing the output of different stages of processing in three state-of-the-art deep networks. We found that recognition accuracy increases with higher stages of visual processing (higher level stages indeed outperforming human participants on the same task) but that human decisions agree best with predictions from intermediate stages. Overall, these results suggest that human participants may rely on visual features of intermediate complexity and that the complexity of visual representations afforded by modern deep network models may exceed those used by human participants during rapid categorization.",

    "abstract": "The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a dual-phase liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC) operating at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. A calibration of nuclear recoils in liquid xenon was performed $\\textit{in situ}$ in the LUX detector using a collimated beam of mono-energetic 2.45 MeV neutrons produced by a deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion source. The nuclear recoil energy from the first neutron scatter in the TPC was reconstructed using the measured scattering angle defined by double-scatter neutron events within the active xenon volume. We measured the absolute charge ($Q_{y}$) and light ($L_{y}$) yields at an average electric field of 180 V/cm for nuclear recoil energies spanning 0.7 to 74 keV and 1.1 to 74 keV, respectively. This calibration of the nuclear recoil signal yields will permit the further refinement of liquid xenon nuclear recoil signal models and, importantly for dark matter searches, clearly demonstrates measured ionization and scintillation signals in this medium at recoil energies down to $\\mathcal{O}$(1 keV).",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has recently led to great successes in tasks such as image recognition (e.g Krizhevsky et al., 2012). However, deep networks are still outmatched by the power and versatility of the brain, perhaps in part due to the richer neuronal computations available to cortical circuits. The challenge is to identify which neuronal mechanisms are relevant, and to find suitable abstractions to model them. Here, we show how aspects of spike timing, long hypothesized to play a crucial role in cortical information processing, could be incorporated into deep networks to build richer, versatile representations. We introduce a neural network formulation based on complex-valued neuronal units that is not only biologically meaningful but also amenable to a variety of deep learning frameworks. Here, units are attributed both a firing rate and a phase, the latter indicating properties of spike timing. We show how this formulation qualitatively captures several aspects thought to be related to neuronal synchrony, including gating of information processing and dynamic binding of distributed object representations. Focusing on the latter, we demonstrate the potential of the approach in several simple experiments. Thus, neuronal synchrony could be a flexible mechanism that fulfills multiple functional roles in deep networks.",

    "abstract": "Causal mediation analysis is widely utilized to separate the causal effect of treatment into its direct effect on the outcome and its indirect effect through an intermediate variable (the mediator). In this study we introduce a functional mediation analysis framework in which the three key variables, the treatment, mediator, and outcome, are all continuous functions. With functional measures, causal assumptions and interpretations are not immediately well-defined. Motivated by a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we propose two functional mediation models based on the influence of the mediator: (1) a concurrent mediation model and (2) a historical mediation model. We further discuss causal assumptions, and elucidate causal interpretations. Our proposed models enable the estimation of individual causal effect curves, where both the direct and indirect effects vary across time. Applied to a task-based fMRI study, we illustrate how our functional mediation framework provides a new perspective for studying dynamic brain connectivity. The R package cfma is available on CRAN.",
