    "abstract": "It  becomes  increasingly  popular  to  perform  mediation  analysis  for  complex  data  from  sophisticated experimental  studies.  In  this  paper,  we  present  Granger  Mediation  Analysis  (GMA),  a  new  framework  for  causal mediation analysis of multiple time series. This framework is motivated by a functional magnetic resonance imaging(fMRI) experiment where we are interested in estimating the mediation effects between a randomized stimulus timeseries and brain activity time series from two brain regions. The stable unit treatment assumption for causal mediation analysis  is  thus  unrealistic  for  this  type  of  time  series  data.  To  address  this  challenge,  our  framework  integrates two  types  of  models:  causal  mediation  analysis  across  the  variables  and  vector  autoregressive  models  across  the temporal observations. We further extend this framework to handle multilevel data to address individual variability and correlated errors between the mediator and the outcome variables. These models not only provide valid causal mediation for time series data but also model the causal dynamics across time. We show that the modeling parameters in our models are identifiable, and we develop computationally efficient methods to maximize the likelihood-based optimization criteria. Simulation studies show that our method reduces the estimation bias and improve statistical power, compared to existing approaches. On a real fMRI data set, our approach not only infers the causal effects ofbrain pathways but accurately captures the feedback effect of the outcome region on the mediator region.Key words:Spatiotemporal dependence; Structural equation modeling; Vector autoregressive models.",

    "abstract": "In many scientific studies, it becomes increasingly important to delineate the causal pathways through a large number of mediators, such as genetic and brain mediators.  Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a popular technique to estimate the pathway effects, commonly expressed as products of coefficients.  However, it becomes unstable to fit such models with high dimensional mediators, especially for a general setting where all the mediators are causally dependent but the exact causal relationships between them are unknown.  This paper proposes a sparse mediation model using a regularized SEM approach,  where sparsity here means that a small number of mediators  have  nonzero  mediation  effects  between  a  treatment  and  an  outcome.   To  address the model selection challenge, we innovate by introducing a new penalty calledPathway Lasso.This penalty function is a convex relaxation of the non-convex product function, and it enables a computationally tractable optimization criterion to estimate and select many pathway effects simultaneously.  We develop a fast ADMM-type algorithm to compute the model parameters,and we show that the iterative updates can be expressed in closed form.  On both simulated data and a real fMRI dataset, the proposed approach yields higher pathway selection accuracy and lower estimation bias than other competing methods.",

    "abstract": "The goal of variable clustering is to partition a random vector X∈R pin sub-groups of similar probabilistic behavior. Popular methods such as hierarchical clustering orK-means are algorith-mic  procedures  applied  to  observations  onX,  while  no  population level target is defined prior to estimation. We take a different view in this paper, where we propose and investigate model based variable clustering. We consider three models, of increasing level of complex-ity, termed generically G-models, with G standing for the partition to be estimated. Motivated by the potential lack of identifiability of the G-latent models, which are currently used in problems involving variable clustering, we introduce two new classes of models, theG-exchangeable and theG-block covariance models. We show that both classes are identifiable, for any distribution of X.Our focus is on clusters that are invariant with respect to unknown monotone transformations of the data, and that can be estimated ina  computationally  feasible  manner.  Both  desiderata  can  be  met  if the clusters correspond to blocks in the copula correlation matrix ofX, assumed to have a Gaussian copula distribution. This motivates the introduction of a new similarity metric for cluster membership,CORD, and a homonymous method for cluster estimation. Central to our work is the derivation of the minimax value of the CORD cluster separation for exact partition recovery. We obtained the surprising result that this value is of order plog(p)/n, irrespective of the number of clusters, or of the size of the smallest cluster. Our new procedure,CORD, available on CRAN, achieves this bound, is easy to implement and has computational complexity that is polynomial inp.",

    "abstract": "Causal mediation analysis usually requires strong assumptions, such as ignorability of the mediator, which may not hold in many social and scientific studies.Motivated by a multilevel randomized treatment experiment using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), this paper proposes a multilevel causal mediation frame-work for data with hierarchically nested structure, and this framework provides valid inference even if structured unmeasured confounding for the mediator and outcome is present. For the first-level data, we propose a linear structural equation model fora continuous mediator and a continuous outcome, both of which may contain correlated additive errors. A likelihood-based approach is proposed to estimate the model coefficients. The analysis of our estimator characterizes the nonidentifiability issue due to the correlation parameter. To address the identifiability issue and model the variability in multilevel data, we propose to incorporate multiple first-level mediation models across different levels in a unified multilevel mediation framework. All the model coefficients are estimated simultaneously by our optimization algorithms, with innovation to estimate the unknown correlation parameter from data, instead of per-forming sensitivity analysis. Our asymptotic analysis shows that the correlation parameter is identifiable, and our estimates for the mediation effects are consistent with the parametric convergence rates. Using extensive simulated data and a real fMRI dataset, we demonstrate the improvement of our approaches over existing methods.",

    "abstract": "This work details the development of a three-dimensional (3D) electric field model for the LUX detector. The detector took data to search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) during two periods. After the first period completed, a time-varying non-uniform negative charge developed in the polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) panels that define the radial boundary of the detector's active volume. This caused electric field variations in the detector in time, depth and azimuth, generating an electrostatic radially-inward force on electrons on their way upward to the liquid surface. To map this behavior, 3D electric field maps of the detector's active volume were generated on a monthly basis. This was done by fitting a model built in COMSOL Multiphysics to the uniformly distributed calibration data that were collected on a regular basis. The modeled average PTFE charge density increased over the course of the exposure from -3.6 to −5.5 μC/m2. From our studies, we deduce that the electric field magnitude varied locally while the mean value of the field of ∼200 V/cm remained constant throughout the exposure. As a result of this work the varying electric fields and their impact on event reconstruction and discrimination were successfully modeled.",

    "abstract": "Antarctic krill Euphausia superba are key components of Antarctic ecosystems, serving as the major prey item for most of the megafauna in the region. Coastal fjords along the West Antarctic Peninsula have been identified as biological hotspots, areas in which high biomasses of both E. superba and their megafauna predators are consistently observed. We investigated feeding by E. superba in fjords and adjacent open waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula. Next generation sequencing of stomach contents from 174 krill indicated a diverse diet, with broad patterns consistent with previous understanding of E. superba feeding. Diatom sequence reads were frequent and abundant, indicating a largely diatom-based diet, while the occasional presence of high abundances of copepod sequence reads suggests carnivory supplemented the diet. Striking differences were observed between the stomach contents of krill collected in fjords and those of krill collected in adjacent open waters. Chaetoceros spp. diatoms made up 71% of the stomach contents sequences of krill collected in fjords, but less than 10% of the stomach contents sequences of krill collected in open waters. These differences could not be explained by differences in the surface water phytoplankton communities, as in both open waters and fjords Chaetoceros spp. made up less than 10% of the surface water sequence read assemblages. These feeding differences highlight the importance of taking into account regional differences in krill feeding when considering E. superba’s roles in Southern Ocean ecosystems, and suggest krill in fjords may make use of vertical structure in phytoplankton assemblages.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is a single-stranded, positive sense RNA virus [1]. T he Zika virus polyprotein consists of precursors of three structural proteins (capsid, precursor membrane (prM) and envelope (E) protein) and seven major nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [2]. ZIKV causes microcephaly and other birth defects in a significant fraction of gestationally infected infants and causes Guillain–Barré syndrome in a very small percentage of infected adults [3,4]. The major transmitters of ZIKV to humans are Aedes mosquitos, especially species Aedes aegypti [5]. It was recently reported that the set of mutations in polyproteins obtained from ZIKV isolated from humans can be partitioned into two subsets [6]: Exclusive (x) subset and Common (c) subset. Mutations in the x subset occur exclusively in the human host. In contrast, mutations in the c subset occur in ZIKV isolated both from human hosts and from the Aedes mosquito vectors. The present report is focused on identification and proposed immunological significance of the bioinformatically predominant member of the exclusively human (x) subset. It is proposed that the mutations that occurred only in the x subset but not in the c subset may reflect biological processes occurring only in humans but not in mosquitos. Some of these processes may be metabolic, some may be conformational, and some may be immunologic. In the work reported here, an amino acid position with prominent bioinformatic properties is identified within the Zika virus polyprotein and a biologic function of that amino acid position is proposed.",

Although a large number of analytical and numerical models have been developed to extract binding and diffusion rates from FRAP recovery curves, active transport of molecules is typically not included in the existing models that are used to estimate these rates. Here we present a validated numerical method for estimating diffusion, binding/unbinding rates, and active transport velocities using FRAP data that captures intracellular dynamics through partial differential equation models. We apply these methods to transport and localization of mRNA molecules in Xenopus laevis oocytes, where active transport processes are essential to generate developmental polarity. By providing estimates of the effective velocities and diffusion, as well as expected run times and lengths, this approach can help quantify dynamical properties of localizing and nonlocalizing RNA. Our results confirm the distinct transport dynamics in different regions of the cytoplasm, and suggest that RNA movement in both the animal and vegetal directions may influence the timescale of RNA localization in Xenopus oocytes. We also show that model initial conditions extracted from FRAP postbleach intensities prevent underestimation of diffusion, which can arise from the instantaneous bleaching assumption. The numerical and modeling approach presented here to estimate parameters using FRAP recovery data is a broadly applicable tool for systems where intracellular transport is a key molecular mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Background\nAmong HIV+ patients, alcohol use is a highly prevalent risk factor for both HIV transmission and poor adherence to HIV treatment. The large-scale implementation of effective interventions for treating alcohol problems remains a challenge in low-income countries with generalized HIV epidemics. It is essential to consider an intervention’s cost-effectiveness in dollars-per-health-outcome, and the long-term economic impact —or “return on investment” in monetary terms.\n\nMethods\nWe conducted a cost-benefit analysis, measuring economic return on investment, of a task-shifted cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention delivered by paraprofessionals to reduce alcohol use in a modeled cohort of 13,440 outpatients in Kenya. In our base-case, we estimated the costs and economic benefits from a societal perspective across a six-year time horizon, with a 3% annual discount rate. Costs included all costs associated with training and administering task-shifted CBT therapy. Benefits included the economic impact of lowered HIV incidence as well as the improvements in household and labor-force productivity. We conducted univariate and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our results.\n\nResults\nUnder the base case, total costs for CBT rollout was $554,000, the value of benefits were $628,000, and the benefit-to-cost ratio was 1.13. Sensitivity analyses showed that under most assumptions, the benefit-to-cost ratio remained above unity indicating that the intervention was cost-saving (i.e., had positive return on investment). The duration of the treatment effect most effected the results in sensitivity analyses.\n\nConclusions\nCBT can be effectively and economically task-shifted to paraprofessionals in Kenya. The intervention can generate not only reductions in morbidity and mortality, but also economic savings for the health system in the medium and long term. The findings have implications for other countries with generalized HIV epidemics, high prevalence of alcohol consumption, and shortages of mental health professionals.\n\nTrial registration\nThis paper uses data derived from “Cognitive Behavioral Treatment to Reduce Alcohol Use Among HIV-Infected Kenyans (KHBS)” with ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT00792519 on 11/17/2008; and preliminary data from “A Stage 2 Cognitive-behavioral Trial: Reduce Alcohol First in Kenya Intervention” (NCT01503255, registered on 12/16/2011).",

To compute the free energy in such phases, we propose to explore the system's potential-energy surface by discrete sampling of local minima by means of a lattice gas Monte Carlo approach and by continuous sampling by means of a lattice dynamics approach in the vicinity of each local minimum. Given the proximity of the local minima, it is necessary to carefully partition phase space by using a Voronoi tessellation to constrain the domain of integration of the partition function in order to avoid double counting artifacts and enable an accurate harmonic treatment near each local minima. We consider the bcc phase of titanium as a prototypical example to illustrate our approach.",

We use recent observational data from the cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations and supernovae type Ia to obtain constraints on the lifetime of the dark matter particle. We find that for an energy splitting where more than 40% of the dark matter particle energy is transferred to massless, relativistic particles in the two-body case, or more than 50% in the many-body case, lifetimes less than the age of the Universe are excluded at more than 95% confidence.

In this paper, we investigate the effect of adding shape correspondence constraints either in the form of pair of corresponding contour fragments or pair of closed curves. We find the shape does not play a significant role in optical flow and stereo correspondence but it does play a significant role when scene content changes are large.

    "abstract": "How focal seizures initiate and evolve in human neocortex remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Here, we use biophysical neuronal network models of neocortical patches to study how the interaction between inhibition and extracellular potassium ([K +] o ) dynamics may contribute to different types of focal seizures. Three main types of propagated focal seizures observed in recent intracortical microelectrode recordings in humans were modelled: seizures characterized by sustained (∼30−60 Hz) gamma local field potential (LFP) oscillations; seizures where the onset in the propagated site consisted of LFP spikes that later evolved into rhythmic (∼2−3 Hz) spike-wave complexes (SWCs); and seizures where a brief stage of low-amplitude fast-oscillation (∼10−20 Hz) LFPs preceded the SWC activity. Our findings are fourfold: (1) The interaction between elevated [K +] o (due to abnormal potassium buffering by glial cells) and the strength of synaptic inhibition plays a predominant role in shaping these three types of seizures. (2) Strengthening of inhibition leads to the onset of sustained narrowband gamma seizures. (3) Transition into SWC seizures is obtained either by the weakening of inhibitory synapses, or by a transient strengthening followed by an inhibitory breakdown (e.g. GABA depletion). This reduction or breakdown of inhibition among fast-spiking (FS) inhibitory interneurons increases their spiking activity and leads them eventually into depolarization block. Ictal spike-wave discharges in the model are then sustained solely by pyramidal neurons. (4) FS cell dynamics are also critical for seizures where the evolution into SWC activity is preceded by low-amplitude fast oscillations. Different levels of elevated [K +] o were important for transitions into and maintenance of sustained gamma oscillations and SWC discharges. Overall, our modelling study predicts that the interaction between inhibitory interneurons and [K +] o glial buffering under abnormal conditions may explain different types of ictal transitions and dynamics during propagated seizures in human focal epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Healthy red blood cells (RBCs) have remarkable deformability, squeezing through narrow capillaries as small as 3 microns in diameter without any damage. However, in many hematological disorders the spectrin network and lipid bilayer of diseased RBCs may be significantly altered, leading to impaired functionality including loss of deformability. We employ a two-component whole-cell multiscale model to quantify the biomechanical characteristics of the healthy and diseased RBCs, including Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs (Pf-RBCs) and defective RBCs in hereditary disorders, such as spherocytosis and elliptocytosis. In particular, we develop a two-step multiscale framework based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) to predict the static and dynamic responses of RBCs subject to tensile forcing, using experimental information only on the structural defects in the lipid bilayer, cytoskeleton, and their interaction. We first employ CGMD on a small RBC patch to compute the shear modulus, bending stiffness, and network parameters, which are subsequently used as input to a whole-cell DPD model to predict the RBC shape and corresponding stress field. For Pf-RBCs at trophozoite and schizont stages, the presence of cytoadherent knobs elevates the shear response in the lipid bilayer and stiffens the RBC membrane. For RBCs in spherocytosis and elliptocytosis, the bilayer-cytoskeleton interaction is weakened, resulting in substantial increase of the tensile stress in the lipid bilayer. Furthermore, we investigate the transient behavior of stretching deformation and shape relaxation of the normal and defective RBCs. Different from the normal RBCs possessing high elasticity, our simulations reveal that the defective RBCs respond irreversibly, i.e., they lose their ability to recover the normal biconcave shape in successive loading cycles of stretching and relaxation. Our findings provide fundamental insights into the microstructure and biomechanics of RBCs, and demonstrate that the two-step multiscale framework presented here can be used effectively for in silico studies of hematological disorders based on first principles and patient-specific experimental input at the protein level.",

    "abstract": "The detection of object boundaries is a critical first step for many visual processing tasks. Multiple cues (we consider luminance, color, motion and binocular disparity) available in the early visual system may signal object boundaries but little is known about their relative diagnosticity and how to optimally combine them for boundary detection. This study thus aims at understanding how early visual processes inform boundary detection in natural scenes. We collected color binocular video sequences of natural scenes to construct a video database. Each scene was annotated with two full sets of ground-truth contours (one set limited to object boundaries and another set which included all edges). We implemented an integrated computational model of early vision that spans all considered cues, and then assessed their diagnosticity by training machine learning classifiers on individual channels. Color and luminance were found to be most diagnostic while stereo and motion were least. Combining all cues yielded a significant improvement in accuracy beyond that of any cue in isolation. Furthermore, the accuracy of individual cues was found to be a poor predictor of their unique contribution for the combination. This result suggested a complex interaction between cues, which we further quantified using regularization techniques. Our systematic assessment of the accuracy of early vision models for boundary detection together with the resulting annotated video dataset should provide a useful benchmark towards the development of higher-level models of visual processing.",

    "abstract": "Primates can recognize objects embedded in complex natural scenes in a glimpse. Rapid categorization paradigms have been extensively used to study our core perceptual abilities when the visual system is forced to operate under strong time constraints. However, the neural underpinning of rapid categorization remains to be understood, and the incredible speed of sight has yet to be reconciled with modern ventral stream cortical theories of object recognition.\n\nHere we recorded multichannel subdural electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals from intermediate areas (V4/PIT) of the ventral stream of the visual cortex while monkeys were actively engaged in a rapid animal/non-animal categorization task. A traditional event-related potential (ERP) analysis revealed short visual latencies (< 50–70 ms) followed by a rapidly developing visual selectivity (within ~ 20–30 ms) for most electrodes. A multi-variate pattern analysis (MVPA) technique further confirmed that reliable animal/non-animal category information was possible from this initial ventral stream neural activity (within ~ 90–100 ms). Furthermore, this early category-selective neural activity was (a) unaffected by the presentation of a backward (pattern) mask, (b) generalized to novel (unfamiliar) stimuli and (c) co-varied with behavioral responses (both accuracy and reaction times). Despite the strong prevalence of task-related information on the neural signal, task-irrelevant visual information could still be decoded independently of monkey behavior. Monkey behavioral responses were also found to correlate significantly with human behavioral responses for the same set of stimuli.\n\nTogether, the present study establishes that rapid ventral stream neural activity induces a visually selective signal subsequently used to drive rapid visual categorization and that this visual strategy may be shared between human and non-human primates.",

Phys. 205, 373 (2005)], and the flux imposition [Flekkøy et al., Europhys. Lett. 52, 271 (2000)], to achieve a target mean value given by the NS solver. Going beyond the mean flow field of the hybrid simulations, we investigate the hydrodynamic fluctuations in the DPD domain. Toward that end, we calculate the transversal autocorrelation functions of the fluctuating variables in \uD835\uDC58 space to evaluate the generation, transport, and dissipation of fluctuations in the presence of a hybrid interface. We quantify the unavoidable errors in the fluctuations, due to both the truncation of the domain and the constraint dynamics performed in the artificial boundary. Furthermore, we compare the four methods of constraint dynamics and demonstrate how to reduce the errors in fluctuations. The analysis and findings of this work are directly applicable to other hybrid simulations of fluid flow with thermal fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Electronic structure calculations, such as those employing Kohn–Sham density functional theory or ab initio wavefunction theories, have allowed for atomistic-level understandings of a wide variety of phenomena and properties of matter at small scales. However, the computational cost of electronic structure methods drastically increases with length and time scales, which makes these methods difficult for long time-scale molecular dynamics simulations or large-sized systems. Machine-learning techniques can provide accurate potentials that can match the quality of electronic structure calculations, provided sufficient training data. These potentials can then be used to rapidly simulate large and long time-scale phenomena at similar quality to the parent electronic structure approach. Machine-learning potentials usually take a bias-free mathematical form and can be readily developed for a wide variety of systems. Electronic structure calculations have favorable properties–namely that they are noiseless and targeted training data can be produced on-demand–that make them particularly well-suited for machine learning. This paper discusses our modular approach to atomistic machine learning through the development of the open-source Atomistic Machine-learning Package (Amp), which allows for representations of both the total and atom-centered potential energy surface, in both periodic and non-periodic systems. Potentials developed through the atom-centered approach are simultaneously applicable for systems with various sizes. Interpolation can be enhanced by introducing custom descriptors of the local environment. We demonstrate this in the current work for Gaussian-type, bispectrum, and Zernike-type descriptors. Amp  has an intuitive and modular structure with an interface through the python scripting language yet has parallelizable fortran components for demanding tasks; it is designed to integrate closely with the widely used Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE), which makes it compatible with a wide variety of commercial and open-source electronic structure codes. We finally demonstrate that the neural network model inside Amp  can accurately interpolate electronic structure energies as well as forces of thousands of multi-species atomic systems.\n\n",

    "abstract": "While Cu is the only electrocatalyst that converts CO2 into meaningful quantities of CH4 fuel, it requires significant overpotentials (onset potential of ∼−0.80 V vs RHE), decreasing energy conversion efficiencies. We report that Mo2C is capable of catalyzing CO2 into CH4 at low potentials (onset potential of ∼−0.55 V vs RHE), where Cu electrocatalysts do not convert CO2. This low-overpotential catalyst was first identified as a candidate by electronic structure calculations, which indicated the free energetics of CO hydrogenation to be more favorable than that on conventional transition metals such as Cu. Despite the low onset potential for CH4, the CH4 has a steep Tafel slope (∼−280 mV/dec), resulting in most of the current passing through the Mo2C electrocatalysts being utilized for the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction. We conducted a detailed theoretical analysis on the basis of density functional theory calculations, microkinetic analysis, and simulated Pourbaix diagrams to suggest the reasons for these characteristics. These analyses suggest that the potential-limiting step in CH4 evolution is the clearing of OH from the surface, while the rate-limiting step is the nonelectrochemical C–O bond scission, resulting in a high OH coverage and a high Tafel slope. Our calculations suggest that this high coverage weakens H binding, causing enhancement of the H2 evolution reaction in comparison to that under CO2-free conditions. This analysis shows that the detailed interaction of theory and experiment can be used to design and analyze operational electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction and other complicated electrocatalytic reactions.",

    "abstract": "Comparative genomics research in non-model species has highlighted how invertebrate hosts possess complex diversified repertoires of immune molecules. The levels of diversification in particular immune gene families appear to differ between invertebrate lineages and even between species within lineages, reflecting differences not only in evolutionary histories, but also in life histories, environmental niches, and pathogen exposures. The goal of this research was to identify immune-related gene families experiencing high levels of diversification in eastern oysters, Crassostrea virginica. Families containing 1) transcripts differentially expressed in eastern oysters in response to bacterial challenge and 2) a larger number of transcripts compared to other species included those coding for the C1q and C-type lectin domain containing proteins (C1qDC and CTLDC), GTPase of the immune-associated proteins (GIMAP), scavenger receptors (SR), fibrinogen-C domain containing proteins (also known as FREPs), dopamine beta-hydrolase (DBH), interferon-inducible 44 (IFI44), serine protease inhibitors, apextrin, and dermatopontin. Phylogenetic analysis of two of the families significantly expanded in bivalves, IFI44 and GIMAP, showed a patchy distribution within both protostomes and deuterostomes, suggesting multiple independent losses and lineage-specific expansions. Increased availability of genomic information for a broader range of non-model species broadly distributed through vertebrate and invertebrate phyla will likely lead to improved knowledge on mechanisms of immune-gene diversification.",

The SLUSCHI code (Solid and Liquid in Ultra Small Coexistence with Hovering Interfaces) drastically simplifies this procedure into an automated package, by implementing the recently-developed small-size coexistence method and putting together a series of steps that lead to final melting point evaluation. Based on density functional theory, SLUSCHI employs Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics techniques under the isobaric–isothermal (NPT) ensemble, with interface to the first-principles code VASP.

    "abstract": "Saprotrophic and parasitic microorganisms secrete proteins into the environment to breakdown macromolecules and obtain nutrients. The molecules secreted are collectively termed the “secretome” and the composition and function of this set of proteins varies depending on the ecology, life cycle, and environment of an organism. Beyond the function of nutrient acquisition, parasitic lineages must also secrete molecules to manipulate their host. Here, we use a combination of de novo genome and transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatic identification of signal peptides to identify the putative secreted proteome of two oomycetes, the facultative parasite Achlya hypogyna and free-living Thraustotheca clavata. By comparing the secretomes of these saprolegnialean oomycetes with that of eight other oomycetes, we were able to characterize the evolution of this protein set across the oomycete clade. These species span the last common ancestor of the two major oomycete families allowing us to identify the ancestral secretome. This putative ancestral secretome consists of at least 84 gene families. Only 11 of these gene families are conserved across all 10 secretomes analyzed and the two major branches in the oomycete radiation. Notably, we have identified expressed elicitin-like effector genes in the saprotrophic decomposer, T. clavata. Phylogenetic analyses show six novel horizontal gene transfers to the oomycete secretome from bacterial and fungal donor lineages, four of which are specific to the Saprolegnialeans. Comparisons between free-living and pathogenic taxa highlight the functional changes of oomycete secretomes associated with shifts in lifestyle.",

Echinoderms serve as excellent model systems for developmental biology due to their diverse developmental mechanisms, tractable laboratory use, and close phylogenetic distance to chordates. In addition, echinoderms are very well represented in the fossil record, including some larval features, making echinoderms a valuable system for studying evolutionary development. The internal relationships of Echinodermata have not been consistently supported across phylogenetic analyses, however, and this has hindered the study of other aspects of their biology. In order to test echinoderm phylogenetic relationships, we sequenced 23 de novo transcriptomes from all five clades of echinoderms. Using multiple phylogenetic methods at a variety of sampling depths we have constructed a well-supported phylogenetic tree of Echinodermata, including support for the sister groups of Asterozoa (sea stars and brittle stars) and Echinozoa (sea urchins and sea cucumbers).

    "abstract": "We have explored the ultrafast molecular structural dynamics associated with charge transfer in N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine using Rydberg fingerprint spectroscopy in conjunction with self-interaction corrected density functional theory. Excitation at 239 nm prepares the molecule in the Franck–Condon region of the 3s state with the charge localized on one of the two amine groups. As seen from the time-dependent Rydberg electron binding energies, the pathway of the rapidly ensuing dynamics leads through several structurally distinct conformers with various degrees of charge localization before reaching the fully charge-delocalized structure on a picosecond time scale. At several steps along the reaction path, the transient structures are identified through a comparison of the spectroscopically observed binding energies with computed values. The molecular structure is seen to evolve dynamically from an initially folded conformer to the stretched form that supports charge delocalization before an equilibrium sets in with forward and backward time constants of 1.19 (0.14) and 2.61 (0.31) ps, respectively. A coherent wavepacket motion in the charge-localized state with a period of 270 (17) fs and damping of 430 (260) fs is observed and tentatively assigned to the nitrogen umbrella motion. The damping time constant indicates the rate of the energy flow into other vibrations that are not activated by the optical excitation.",

We employ both non-linear unmixing of Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) visible to near-infrared (VNIR) reflectance data and linear unmixing of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity data to quantitatively analyze the kaolin-group mineral within this deposit. We use a novel approach for quantitative analysis of CRISM data through non-linear unmixing with in-scene, orbitally-derived endmembers combined with laboratory measured endmembers. Results from this approach indicate that the deposit within Kashira crater is best modeled as a combination of surrounding spectral units (i.e., in-scene derived endmembers) with the addition of the kaolin-group mineral halloysite. Linear unmixing of TES data suggest that the deposit contains ∼30% halloysite, a result that is supported by a sensitivity analysis. Potential formation mechanisms for this deposit include hydrothermal alteration, arid-environment pedogenic weathering of a basaltic mound deposit, or pedogenic weathering of a volcanic ash deposit. Our modeling results offer a quantitative reconciliation of the CRISM and TES datasets, and provide a consistent mineralogy from spectral unmixing for an aqueous alteration mineral-bearing deposit on Mars using a combined analysis of both VNIR and TIR hyperspectral data.",

Here we report on key structural, dynamic, and aggregation kinetic parameters of Aβ43, extended by a single threonine at the C-terminus relative to Aβ42. Using aggregation time course experiments, electron microscopy, and a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance measurements including backbone relaxation, dark-state exchange saturation transfer, and quantification of chemical shift differences and scalar coupling constants, we demonstrate that the C-terminal threonine in Aβ43 increases the rate and extent of protofibril aggregation and confers slow C-terminal motions in the monomeric and protofibril-bound forms of Aβ43. Relative to the neighboring residues, the hydrophilic Thr43 of Aβ43 favors direct contact with the protofibril surface more so than the C-terminus of Aβ40 or Aβ42. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential of a small chemical modification to affect the properties of Aβ structure and aggregation, providing a mechanism for the potential role of Aβ43 as a primary nucleator of Aβ aggregates in Alzheimer’s disease.",

The properties considered include melting point, heat of fusion, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficients, thermal stability and sublattice disordering, as illustrated in a motivating example of lanthanum zirconate (La2Zr2O7). This work also sheds light on the unresolved controversy of possible phase transition before melting and identifies specific mechanisms responsible for the material’s high melting point. This study benefits from the use of two very recent techniques: (i) a new small-cell coexistence method that enables the accurate and efficient determination of the melting points from ab initio calculations alone; (ii) the experimental determination of solid structure at high temperatures by high-temperature synchrotron X-ray diffraction of laser-heated aerodynamically levitated samples.",

    "abstract": "In the current era of effective antiretroviral treatment, the number of older adults living with HIV is rapidly increasing. This study investigated the combined influence of age and HIV infection on longitudinal changes in verbal and visuospatial learning and memory. Method: In this longitudinal, case-control design, 54 HIV seropositive and 30 seronegative individuals aged 40–74 years received neurocognitive assessments at baseline visits and again one year later. Assessment included tests of verbal and visuospatial learning and memory. Linear regression was used to predict baseline performance and longitudinal change on each test using HIV serostatus, age, and their interaction as predictors. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to assess the effects of these predictors on overall baseline performance and overall longitudinal change. Results: The interaction of HIV and age significantly predicted longitudinal change in verbal memory performance, as did HIV status, indicating that although the seropositive group declined more than the seronegative group overall, the rate of decline depended on age such that greater age was associated with a greater decline in this group. The regression models for visuospatial learning and memory were significant at baseline, but did not predict change over time. HIV status significantly predicted overall baseline performance and overall longitudinal change. Conclusions: This is the first longitudinal study focused on the effects of age and HIV on memory. Findings suggest that age and HIV interact to produce larger declines in verbal memory over time. Further research is needed to gain a greater understanding of the effects of HIV on the aging brain.",

    "abstract": "The American oyster Crassostrea virginica, an ecologically and economically important estuarine organism, can suffer high mortalities in areas in the Northeast United States due to Roseovarius Oyster Disease (ROD), caused by the gram-negative bacterial pathogen Roseovarius crassostreae. The goals of this research were to provide insights into: 1) the responses of American oysters to R. crassostreae, and 2) potential mechanisms of resistance or susceptibility to ROD. The responses of oysters to bacterial challenge were characterized by exposing oysters from ROD-resistant and susceptible families to R. crassostreae, followed by high-throughput sequencing of cDNA samples from various timepoints after disease challenge. Sequence data was assembled into a reference transcriptome and analyzed through differential gene expression and functional enrichment to uncover genes and processes potentially involved in responses to ROD in the American oyster. While susceptible oysters experienced constant levels of mortality when challenged with R. crassostreae, resistant oysters showed levels of mortality similar to non-challenged oysters. Oysters exposed to R. crassostreae showed differential expression of transcripts involved in immune recognition, signaling, protease inhibition, detoxification, and apoptosis. Transcripts involved in metabolism were enriched in susceptible oysters, suggesting that bacterial infection places a large metabolic demand on these oysters. Transcripts differentially expressed in resistant oysters in response to infection included the immune modulators IL-17 and arginase, as well as several genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling. The identification of potential genes and processes responsible for defense against R. crassostreae in the American oyster provides insights into potential mechanisms of disease resistance.",

We find that the inhibitor of serine protease (soybean trypsin inhibitor) effectively blocks proper transition of the sea star fertilization envelope into a protective sperm repellent, whereas inhibitors of the other main types of proteases had no effect. Scanning the transcriptomes of 15 different echinoderm ovaries revealed sequences of high conservation to the originally identified sea urchin cortical serine protease, CGSP1. These conserved sequences contained the catalytic triad necessary for enzymatic activity, and the tandemly repeated LDLr-like repeats. We conclude that the protease involved in the slow block to polyspermy is an essential and conserved element of fertilization in echinoderms, and may provide an important reagent for identification and testing of the cell surface proteins in eggs necessary for sperm binding.",

    "abstract": "MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) is an emerging infectious disease threat, caused by the single-stranded, positive sense (+) RNA MERS-Cov, a highly virulent coronavirus [1,2]. In this editorial report, the immunobioinformatic techniques previously applied to influenza A, described elsewhere in this issue of the Journal of Medical Microbiology and Diagnosis [3] are applied to the spike protein (S) of human MERS-Cov. The S protein is precursor of the S1 and S2 proteins. S1 protein contains a receptor binding domain (RBD; amino acid positions 367–606) which binds to CD26 on the target lymphocyte membrane [4,5]. S2 protein probably facilitates membrane fusion and entry of bound MERS-Cov into the target cell. The dataset of 13 complete MERS-Cov S human protein sequences was downloaded from GenBank [6] on July 4, 2014. Hamming distance (D; [7,8]) and Bepipred Score [9] were determined for each of the 1353 S protein amino acid positions (Figure 1). There were 14 amino acid positions with D>0.0 (Figure 1, top). Three of these 14 amino acid positions were within the RBD in the S1 region of the S protein (positions 400, 506, 520). Amino acid 520 possessed a Bepipred Score of 0.437, which is above the recommended cutoff of 0.350. These results suggest that an A520S mutation at an S1 protein epitope within the RBD domain influences the evolutionary trajectory of MERS-Cov by mechanisms involving host immunological responses. Such a mutation may be a component of a suitable epitope target for a preventive vaccine [10]. The maximum observed value of D was at amino acid position 1020, within the the S2 region of the S protein. The Bepipred Score at this position was only 0.302, below the recommended threshold of 0.350, however position 1020 is located between two epitopic regions beginning at position 1010 and ending at amino acid position 1031. It remains to be determined whether the relatively high D value at position 1020 reflects non-immunological forces or whether amino acid 1020 is a component of one of the closely neighboring epitope regions. The mutations observed at S protein position 1020 were H1020R and H1020Q. Histidine is an essential amino acid, which suggests that host dietary factors may be involved in the mutations at position 1020. All three of the amino acids occurring at position 1020 possess nitrogen-containing side-chains. Thus, these results suggest viral structural influences and constraints on the viral mutational process at S protein position 1020. Contiguous positions 1158 and 1159 each had a positive D value and significant Bepipred Score in a densely epitopic section of the S2 region of the S protein. These results suggest antigenic activity of the S protein in a non-RBD region. Such an epitope may serve as a vaccine antigen target to ameliorate, but not prevent, MERS. It is proposed, and hoped, that the results presented in this editorial demonstrate the potential usefulness of immunobioinformatic analysis of MERS-Cov as a tool to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of MERS on a level that assists our ability to design protective strategies, treatments and vaccines.",

Almost all (97.22%) of nucleotide positions at which the Hamming distance was zero were in the HA2 domain of the HA gene; the invariant nucleotides occupied second and first codon positions except for a tail-region encoded invariant tryptophan. In contrast with the results at the nucleotide level, the patterns of epitope distribution in the encoded HA proteins were similar except for a 25-amino acid sequence (283-307) in the HA1 region of HA H6N1.

Gustavus is a member of an ECS-type E3 ligase which interacts with Vasa, a DEAD-box RNA helicase, to regulate its localization during sea urchin embryonic development, and Gustavus mRNA accumulation is highly localized and dynamic during development. We tested if the core complex for Gustavus function was present in the embryo and if other SOCS box proteins also had restricted expression profiles that would inform future research. Expression patterns of the key members of the proteasomal function, such as the E3 core complex which interacts with Gustavus, and other E3-SOCS box proteins, are widely spread and dynamic in early development of the embryo suggesting broad core complex availability in the proteasome degradation pathway and temporal/spatial enrichments of various E3 ligase dependent targeting mechanisms.",

We investigate the origin of photosynthetic PEPC, a key enzyme of both the CAM and C4 pathways. We combine phylogenetic analyses of genes encoding PEPC with analyses of RNA sequence data of Portulaca, the only plants known to perform both CAM and C4 photosynthesis. Three distinct gene lineages encoding PEPC exist in eudicots (namely ppc-1E1, ppc-1E2 and ppc-2), one of which (ppc-1E1) was recurrently recruited for use in both CAM and C4 photosynthesis within the Caryophyllales. This gene is present in multiple copies in the cacti and relatives, including Portulaca. The PEPC involved in the CAM and C4 cycles of Portulaca are encoded by closely related yet distinct genes. The CAM-specific gene is similar to genes from related CAM taxa, suggesting that CAM has evolved before C4 in these species. The similar origin of PEPC and other genes involved in the CAM and C4 cycles highlights the shared early steps of evolutionary trajectories towards CAM and C4, which probably diverged irreversibly only during the optimization of CAM and C4 phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Most important organismal adaptations are not actually single traits, but complex trait syndromes that are evolutionarily integrated into a single emergent phenotype. Two alternative photosynthetic pathways, C4 photosynthesis and crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM), are primary plant adaptations of this sort, each requiring multiple biochemical and anatomical modifications. Phylogenetic methods are a promising approach for teasing apart the order of character acquisition during the evolution of complex traits, and the phylogenetic placement of intermediate phenotypes as sister taxa to fully optimized syndromes has been taken as good evidence of an ‘ordered’ evolutionary trajectory. But how much power does the phylogenetic approach have to detect ordered evolution? This study simulated ordered and unordered character evolution across a diverse set of phylogenetic trees to understand how tree size, models of evolution, and sampling efforts influence the ability to detect an evolutionary trajectory. The simulations show that small trees (15 taxa) do not contain enough information to correctly infer either an ordered or unordered trajectory, although inference improves as tree size and sampling increases. However, even when working with a 1000-taxon tree, the possibility of inferring the incorrect evolutionary model (type I/type II error) remains. Caution is needed when interpreting the phylogenetic placement of intermediate phenotypes, especially in small lineages. Such phylogenetic patterns can provide a line of evidence for the existence of a particular evolutionary trajectory, but they should be coupled with other types of data to infer the stepwise evolution of a complex character trait.",

    "abstract": "The raw computational power of GPU accelerators enables fast denoising of 3D MR images using bilateral filtering, anisotropic diffusion, and non-local means. In practice, applying these filtering operations requires setting multiple parameters. This study was designed to provide better guidance to practitioners for choosing the most appropriate parameters by answering two questions: what parameters yield the best denoising results in practice? And what tuning is necessary to achieve optimal performance on a modern GPU? To answer the first question, we use two different metrics, mean squared error (MSE) and mean structural similarity (MSSIM), to compare denoising quality against a reference image. Surprisingly, the best improvement in structural similarity with the bilateral filter is achieved with a small stencil size that lies within the range of real-time execution on an NVIDIA Tesla M2050 GPU. Moreover, inappropriate choices for parameters, especially scaling parameters, can yield very poor denoising performance. To answer the second question, we perform an autotuning study to empirically determine optimal memory tiling on the GPU. The variation in these results suggests that such tuning is an essential step in achieving real-time performance. These results have important implications for the real-time application of denoising to MR images in clinical settings that require fast turn-around times.",

We implement this approach in a prototype assembler, called Genome Assembly by Bayesian Inference (GABI), and illustrate its application to the bacteriophage X174. Our sampling strategy achieves both good mixing and convergence on Illumina test data for X174, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. We summarize the posterior distribution of assembly hypotheses generated by GABI as a majority-rule consensus assembly.

    "abstract": "The activity of heterogeneous catalysts is often limited by a strong correlation between the chemisorption energies of reaction intermediates described by the “scaling relations” among the transition metals. We present electronic structure calculations that suggest that metal carbides do not in general follow the transition-metal scaling relations and tend to exhibit a carbophobic departure relative to the transition metals, meaning they tend to bind carbon-bound species weakly compared to oxygen-bound species. This contrasts with the oxophobic departure exhibited by Pt and Pd. Relative to the parent metals, carbides tend to bind carbon and oxygen more weakly and hydrogen more strongly. The departures are rationalized with the adsorbate–surface valence configuration and the energy of the metal sp-states. We employ these general trends to aid in the understanding of various catalytic properties such as the high activity of iron carbides for Fischer–Tropsch synthesis and Pt-group catalysts for partial oxidation of methane. These conclusions are shown to extend beyond atomic probe adsorbates to molecular fragments of relevance to catalysis, making these concepts generally useful for the theory-based design of catalytic materials.",

Although visual adaptation and plasticity have been extensively studied while participants are awake, little is known about what happens while they are asleep. It has been documented that sleep structure as measured by sleep stages using polysomnography is altered specifically in the first sleep session due to exposure to a new sleep environment, known as the first-night effect (FNE). However, the impact of the FNE on spontaneous oscillations in the visual system is poorly understood. How does the FNE affect the visual system during sleep? To address this question, the present study examined whether the FNE modifies the strength of slow-wave activity (SWA, 1–4 Hz)—the dominant spontaneous brain oscillation in slow-wave sleep—in the visual areas. We measured the strength of SWA originating in the visual areas during the first and the second sleep sessions. Magnetoencephalography, polysomnography, and magnetic resonance imaging were used to localize the source of SWA to the visual areas. The visual areas were objectively defined using retinotopic mapping and an automated anatomical parcellation technique. The results showed that the strength of SWA was reduced in the first sleep session in comparison to the second sleep session, especially during slow-wave sleep, in the ventral part of the visual areas. These results suggest that environmental novelty may affect the visual system through suppression of SWA. The impact of the FNE may not be negligible in vision research.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of an obligate parasitic lifestyle is often associated with genomic reduction, in particular with the loss of functions associated with increasing host-dependence. This is evident in many parasites, but perhaps the most extreme transitions are from free-living autotrophic algae to obligate parasites. The best-known examples of this are the apicomplexans such as Plasmodium, which evolved from algae with red secondary plastids. However, an analogous transition also took place independently in the Helicosporidia, where an obligate parasite of animals with an intracellular infection mechanism evolved from algae with green primary plastids. We characterised the nuclear genome of Helicosporidium to compare its transition to parasitism with that of apicomplexans. The Helicosporidium genome is small and compact, even by comparison with the relatively small genomes of the closely related green algae Chlorella and Coccomyxa, but at the functional level we find almost no evidence for reduction. Nearly all ancestral metabolic functions are retained, with the single major exception of photosynthesis, and even here reduction is not complete. The great majority of genes for light-harvesting complexes, photosystems, and pigment biosynthesis have been lost, but those for other photosynthesis-related functions, such as Calvin cycle, are retained. Rather than loss of whole function categories, the predominant reductive force in the Helicosporidium genome is a contraction of gene family complexity, but even here most losses affect families associated with genome maintenance and expression, not functions associated with host-dependence. Other gene families appear to have expanded in response to parasitism, in particular chitinases, including those predicted to digest the chitinous barriers of the insect host or remodel the cell wall of Helicosporidium. Overall, the Helicosporidium genome presents a fascinating picture of the early stages of a transition from free-living autotroph to parasitic heterotroph where host-independence has been unexpectedly preserved.",

In humans, mutations in the dysferlin gene are associated with muscular dystrophy. In this study, we isolated plasma membrane-enriched fractions from full-grown immature oocytes of the sea star, and identified dysferlin by mass spectrometry analysis. The full-length dysferlin sequence is highly conserved between human and the sea star. We learned that in the sea star Patiria miniata, dysferlin RNA and protein are expressed from oogenesis to gastrulation. Interestingly, the protein is highly enriched in the plasma membrane of oocytes. Injection of a morpholino against dysferlin leads to a decrease of endocytosis in oocytes, and to a developmental arrest during gastrulation. These results suggest that dysferlin is critical for normal endocytosis during oogenesis and for embryogenesis in the sea star and that this animal may be a useful model for studying the relationship of dysferlin structure as it relates to its function.",

With one arc-minute resolution, 3.8 π steradians of visual surround, head-tracked stereo, and an almost seamless screen, this Cave offers advances to the state-of-the-art virtual reality experience. This improvement is achieved with the installation of 69 high-resolution long throw projectors, a cylindrical screen with conical ceiling, and a 135 square foot rear-projection floor. Though Caves have been around for over 20 years, they have remained impractical for many potential uses due to their limited resolution, brightness, and overall immersion. Brown's new Cave aims to bridge this gap.",

In this article, we report the experimental exchange current densities for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on eight mono- and bimetallic carbide electrocatalysts and correlate the current densities to hydrogen binding energies that we have calculated via electronic structure computations. We find these materials to have activities higher than those of their parent metals and intermediate between the catalytic activities of the Pt group and early transition-metal surfaces. Increased HER activities on metal carbides relative to their parent metals can be understood with a 3-fold higher sensitivity of metal carbides to the coverage-induced weakening of hydrogen adsorption relative to metal surfaces. The trends presented here can be useful for the design of bimetallic carbide electrocatalysts.",

We compared the projected HIV incidence in 2020 and 2040 if current approaches continue to be used to the incidence if one or more of the following hypothetical interventions were applied: increased HIV testing, improved access to substance abuse treatment, increased use of needle and syringe programs, scaled-up treatment as prevention, and a “high impact” combination scenario, consisting of all of the strategies listed above. No strategy completely eliminated HIV transmission. The high-impact combination strategy produced the largest decrease in HIV incidence—a 62 percent reduction compared to the status quo.

    "abstract": "The rapidly increasing availability of complete bacterial genomes has created new opportunities for reconstructing bacterial evolution, but it has also highlighted the difficulty to fully understand the genomic and functional variations occurring among different lineages. Using the class Epsilonproteobacteria as a case study, we investigated the composition, flexibility, and function of its pan-genomes. Models were constructed to extrapolate the expansion of pan-genomes at three different taxonomic levels. The results show that, for Epsilonproteobacteria the seemingly large genome variations among strains of the same species are less noticeable when compared with groups at higher taxonomic ranks, indicating that genome stability is imposed by the potential existence of taxonomic boundaries. The analyses of pan-genomes has also defined a set of universally conserved core genes, based on which a phylogenetic tree was constructed to confirm that thermophilic species from deep-sea hydrothermal vents represent the most ancient lineages of Epsilonproteobacteria. Moreover, by comparing the flexible genome of a chemoautotrophic deep-sea vent species to (1) genomes of species belonging to the same genus, but inhabiting different environments, and (2) genomes of other vent species, but belonging to different genera, we were able to delineate the relative importance of lineage-specific versus niche-specific genes. This result not only emphasizes the overall importance of phylogenetic proximity in shaping the variable part of the genome, but also highlights the adaptive functions of niche-specific genes. Overall, by modeling the expansion of pan-genomes and analyzing core and flexible genes, this study provides snapshots on how the complex processes of gene acquisition, conservation, and removal affect the evolution of different species, and contribute to the metabolic diversity and versatility of Epsilonproteobacteria.",

    "abstract": "As the complexity of atomistic simulations in catalysis and surface science increases, the challenge of manually finding the lowest-energy adsorbate–surface geometries grows significantly. In the current work, a global optimization approach that preserves adsorbate identity is applied to enable the automated search for optimized binding geometries. This technique is based on the minima hopping method developed by Goedecker, but is modified to preserve the molecular identity of adsorbates by the application of a new class of Hookean constraints. These constraints are completely inactive when the adsorbate identity is preserved, but act to restore the adsorbate structure via a Hookean force when the bond length exceeds a threshold distance. Additionally, a related Hookean constraint has been developed to prevent adsorbates (particularly such adsorbates as CO and CH2O that have stable gas-phase forms) from volatilizing during the molecular dynamics portion of the minima hopping technique. This combination, referred to herein as the constrained minima hopping method, was tested for its suitability in finding the minimum-energy binding configuration for a set of 17 C x H y O z adsorbates on a stepped Cu fcc(211) surface and in all cases found the global minima in comparable or fewer steps than the previous brute force methodologies. It is expected that methods such as this will be crucial to finding low-energy states in more complex systems, such as those with high coverages of adsorbed species or in the presence of explicit solvent molecules.\n\n",

The two steels have different microstructures, with the martensite volume fraction in DP980 being ∼60%, compared to ∼40% in DF140T. Nevertheless, they exhibit similar uniaxial stress–strain behavior. To determine the microstructural origin of this behavior, micropillar compression specimens from ferrite and martensitic phases in both steels were deformed in uniaxial compression to obtain their individual response. A microstructure-based crystal plasticity model that accounts for non-Schmid behavior in the ferrite phase and contains a detailed description of the hierarchical microstructure of martensite was developed and material parameters were determined by fitting model predictions to the micropillar compression data. The crystal plasticity model was then used to predict the flow stress and strain rate partitioning during uniaxial tensile deformation of the two steels. The ferrite phase in the two steels was found to have similar flow strength. In contrast, the flow stress of martensite in DF140T was found to be approximately twice that in DP980. This strength difference is offset by the difference in martensite volume fraction in the two steels, resulting in nearly identical uniaxial tensile behavior. The strain rate partitioning and interfacial stress distributions in the two steels differ significantly, however, and have important implications on their tensile ductility.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomorphic catalytic systems can exhibit enhanced or inhibited activity relative to the pure surface parent metal, based on a combination of strain and ligand effects. In contrast, mechanically strained and dealloyed systems can exhibit pure strain effects. Density functional calculations for hydrogen adsorption at different coverages between 0.25 and 1 monolayer on biaxially strained Pd(111) are carried out to illustrate its differing catalytic behavior for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in comparison to selected pseudomorphic Pd overlayers (Pd/M). The separation of the ligand and strain effects present in Pd/M pseudomorphs and the consequent modification of the binding strengths caused by them individually are estimated. The strain exhibits a systematic contribution to binding energy changes while the ligand effect can act to either intensify or weaken the strain effect. In certain systems (e.g., Pd/Ir) the ligand effect is more pronounced than the strain effect while in others (e.g., Pd/Au) the strain effect is larger. The individual contributions of strain and ligand effects to shifts in the d-band center are also calculated and found to correlate well with the observed binding energy changes. We suggest that in the absence of a ligand effect—as would be expected in mechanically strained Pd (111)—H binding is tunable, and a differential free energy of hydrogen adsorption of ∼0 eV (at 0 V vs RHE) is achieved at various combinations of strain and coverage. For pure Pd under compressive strain, this leads to a prediction of a broad region of enhanced activity for the HER which may compare favorably to Pd overlayers supported on more expensive metals such as Pt and PtRu.",

Here, we show experimentally and theoretically that B36 is a highly stable quasiplanar boron cluster with a central hexagonal hole, providing the first experimental evidence that single-atom layer boron sheets with hexagonal vacancies are potentially viable. Photoelectron spectroscopy of B36− reveals a relatively simple spectrum, suggesting a symmetric cluster. Global minimum searches for B36− lead to a quasiplanar structure with a central hexagonal hole. Neutral B36 is the smallest boron cluster to have sixfold symmetry and a perfect hexagonal vacancy, and it can be viewed as a potential basis for extended two-dimensional boron sheets.",

    "abstract": "The simulation of electrochemical reaction dynamics from first principles remains challenging, since over the course of an elementary step, an electron is either consumed or produced by the electrode. For example, the hydrogen evolution reaction begins with a simple proton discharge to a metal surface, but with conventional electronic structure methods, the simulated potential, which is manifested as the metal’s workfunction, varies over the course of the simulation as the electron is consumed in the new metal–hydrogen bond. Here, we present a simple approach to allow the direct control of the electrochemical potential via charging of the electrode surface. This is achieved by changing the total number of electrons in the self-consistent cycle, while enforcing charge neutrality through the introduction of a jellium counter charge dispersed in an implicit solvent region above the slab. We observe that the excess electrons localize selectively at the metal’s reactive surface and that the metal workfunction responds nearly linearly to the variation in electronic count. This linear response allows for control of the potential in simulations with a minimal computational penalty compared to standard electronic structure calculations. This scheme can be straightforwardly implemented with common electronic structure calculators (density functional theory in the present work), and we find this method to be compatible with the commonly used computational hydrogen electrode model, which we expect will make it useful in the construction of potential-dependent free-energy diagrams in electrochemistry. We apply this approach to the proton-deposition (Volmer) step on both Au(111) and Pt(111) surfaces and show that we can reliably control the simulated electrode potential and thus assess the potential dependence of the initial, transition, and final states. Our method allows us to directly assess the location along the reaction pathway with the greatest amount of charge transfer, which we find to correspond well with the reaction barrier, indicating this reaction is a concerted proton–electron transfer. Interestingly, we show that the Pt electrode has not only a more favorable equilibrium energy with adsorbed hydrogen but also a lower intrinsic barrier under thermoneutral conditions.",

Among the TMC/rGO nanocomposites, only Mo2C/rGO exhibited an obvious increase in the capacitance-normalized current density compared to the bulk powder. We performed density functional theory calculations which suggest that the distinctive activity of Mo2C can be attributed to the structure-sensitive binding energies of atomic H, which binds less strongly on the stepped surface than the flat surface of Mo2C, while other TMCs do not exhibit clear structure-sensitivity. The charge transfer resistances were significantly reduced by using rGO as the substrate, but its correlation with the HER activity was not strong. An analysis of the kinetic data suggested that hydrogen evolution on the TMC surface follows the Volmer–Tafel mechanism with the Tafel step (recombination) rate limiting, which is responsible to the weak correlation between the charge transfer properties and HER activity.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous catalysts control the rates of chemical reactions by changing the energy levels of bound intermediates relative to one another. However, the design flexibility in catalysis is limited by scaling relations: when a catalyst binds one adsorbate more strongly, it tends to bind similar adsorbates more strongly as well. Here we show how strain can break this constraint by employing a mechanics-based eigenstress model to rationalize the effect of strain on adsorbate–catalyst bonding. This model suggests that the sign of the binding-energy response to strain depends on the coupling of the adsorbate-induced eigenstress with the applied strain; thus, tensile strain can make binding either stronger or weaker, depending on the eigenstress characteristics of the adsorbate on the surface. We then suggest how these principles can be used in conjunction with anisotropic strain to engineer opposite responses of adjacent adsorbates to strain; such effects are expected to allow larger changes to reaction rates than predicted by scaling relations.",

It was therefore surprising when 18S rDNA surveys of protists in the West Antarctic Peninsula in winter revealed high abundances of parasite sequences. Parasite sequences made up, on average, over half (52%) of sequence reads in samples from deep water in winter. Winter surface water and sediment samples contained relatively fewer, but still strikingly high, parasite sequence reads (13 and 9%, respectively), while surface water samples in summer contained fewer parasite sequences (1.8%). A total of 1028 distinct parasite Operational Taxonomic Units were observed in winter, with the largest abundances and diversities within Syndiniales groups I and II, including Amoebophrya. Less abundant parasite sequence groups included Apicomplexa, Blastodinium, Chytriodinium, Cryptocaryon, Paradinium, Perkinsidae, Pirsonia and Ichthyophonae. Parasite sequence distributions suggested interactions with known hosts, such as diatom parasites which were mainly in the sediments, where resting spores of Chaetoceros spp. diatoms were abundant. Syndiniales sequences were correlated with radiolarian sequences, suggesting parasite–host interactions. The abundant proportions of parasite sequences indicate a potentially important role for parasites in the Antarctic marine ecosystem, with implications for plankton population dynamics, the role of the microbial loop, carbon flows and ecosystem responses to ongoing anthropogenic climate change.",

We develop a new technique to characterize the spatial variation of the point-spread function that enables us to circularize the field to better than 0.5% and thereby extract the intrinsic galaxy ellipticities. By fitting photometric redshifts to sources in the observation, we are able to select a sample of background galaxies for weak-lensing analysis free from low-redshift contaminants. Photometric redshifts are also used to select a high-redshift galaxy subsample with which we successfully isolate the signal from an interloping z = 0.44 cluster. We estimate the total mass of Abell 3128 by fitting the tangential ellipticity of background galaxies with the weak-lensing shear profile of a Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) halo and also perform NFW fits to substructures detected in the 2D mass maps of the cluster.

    "abstract": "Although all functional movement arises from the interplay between the neurological, skeletal, and muscular systems, it is the skeletal system that forms the basic framework for functional movement. Central to understanding human neuromuscular development, along with the genesis of musculoskeletal pathologies, is quantifying how the human skeletal system adapts and mal-adapts to its mechanical environment. Advancing this understanding is hampered by an inability to directly and non-invasively measure in vivo strains, stresses, and forces on bone. Thus, we traditionally have turned to animal models to garner such information. These models enable direct in vivo measures that are not available for human subjects, providing information in regards to both skeletal adaptation and the interplay between the skeletal and muscular systems. Recently, there has been an explosion of new imaging and modeling techniques providing non-invasive, in vivo measures and estimates of skeletal form and function that have long been missing. Combining multiple modalities and techniques has proven to be one of our most valuable resources in enhancing our understanding of the form-function relationship of the human skeletal, muscular, and neurological systems. Thus, to continue advancing our knowledge of the structural-functional relationship, validation of current tools is needed, while development is required to limit the deficiencies in these tools and develop new ones.\n\n",

However, it remains unclear whether white matter microstructure in these regions is associated with age-related decline in EF and/or CPS. We utilized quantitative tractography metrics derived from diffusion-tensor MRI to investigate the relationship between the mean fiber bundle lengths (FBLs) projecting to different lobes, and EF/CPS performance in 73 healthy aging adults. We measured aspects of EF and CPS with the Trail Making Test (TMT), Color-Word Interference Test, Letter-Number Sequencing (L-N Seq), and Symbol Coding. Results revealed that parietal and occipital FBLs explained a significant portion of variance in EF. Frontal, temporal, and occipital FBLs explained a significant portion of variance in CPS. Shorter occipital FBLs were associated with poorer performance on the EF tests TMT-B and CWIT 3. Shorter frontal, parietal, and occipital FBLs were associated with poorer performance on L-N Seq and Symbol Coding. Shorter frontal and temporal FBLs were associated with lower performance on CPS tests TMT-A and CWIT 1. Shorter FBLs were also associated with increased age. Results suggest an age-related FBL shortening in specific brain regions related to poorer EF and CPS performance among older adults. Overall, results support both the frontal aging hypothesis and processing speed theory, suggesting that each mechanism is contributing to age-related cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Direct dehydrogenation of methanol to produce anhydrous formaldehyde is investigated using periodic density functional theory (DFT) and combining the microkinetic model to estimate rates and selectivities on stepped (211) surfaces under a desired reaction condition. Binding energies of reaction intermediates and transition state energies for each elementary reaction can be accurately scaled with CHO and OH binding energies as the only descriptors. Based on these two descriptors, a steady-state microkinetic model is constructed with a piecewise adsorbate–adsorbate interaction model that explicitly includes the effects of adsorbate coverage on the rates and selectivities as well as the volcano plots are obtained. Our results show that most of the stepped (211) pure-metallic surfaces such as Au, Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Ni, Fe, and Co are located in a region of low activity and selectivity toward CH2O production due to higher rate for CH2O dehydrogenation than CH2O desorption. The selectivities toward CH2O production on Zn, Cu, and Ag surfaces are located on the boundary between the high and low selectivity regions. To find suitable catalysts for anhydrous CH2O production, a large number of A3B-type transition metal alloys are screened based on their predicted rates and selectivities, as well as their estimated stabilities and prices. We finally propose several promising candidates for the dehydrogenation of CH3OH.",

    "abstract": "Non-accidental properties (NAPs) correspond to image properties that are invariant to changes in viewpoint (e.g., straight vs. curved contours) and are distinguished from metric properties (MPs) that can change continuously with in-depth object rotation (e.g., aspect ratio, degree of curvature, etc.). Behavioral and electrophysiological studies of shape processing have demonstrated greater sensitivity to differences in NAPs than in MPs. However, previous work has shown that such sensitivity is lacking in multiple-views models of object recognition such as HMAX. These models typically assume that object processing is based on populations of view-tuned neurons with distributed symmetrical bell-shaped tuning that are modulated at least as much by differences in MPs as in NAPs. Here, we test the hypothesis that unsupervised learning of invariances to object transformations may increase the sensitivity to differences in NAPs vs. MPs in HMAX. We collected a database of video sequences with objects slowly rotating in-depth in an attempt to mimic sequences viewed during object manipulation by young children during early developmental stages. We show that unsupervised learning yields shape-tuning in higher stages with greater sensitivity to differences in NAPs vs. MPs in agreement with monkey IT data. Together, these results suggest that greater NAP sensitivity may arise from experiencing different in-depth rotations of objects.\n\n",

Although we know that different tasks are typically associated with systematic differences in behavioral responses, to date, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Here, we implemented a single integrated paradigm that links perceptual processes with categorization processes. Using a large image database of natural scenes, we trained machine-learning classifiers to derive quantitative measures of task-specific perceptual discriminability based on the distance between individual images and different categorization boundaries. We showed that the resulting discriminability measure accurately predicts variations in behavioral responses across categorization tasks and stimulus sets. We further used the model to design an experiment, which challenged previous interpretations of the so-called “superordinate advantage.” Overall, our study suggests that observed differences in behavioral responses across rapid categorization tasks reflect natural variations in perceptual discriminability.",

    "abstract": "The well-known hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) volcano plot describes the relationship between H binding energy and the corresponding hydrogen evolution catalytic activity, which depends on the species of metal. Under CO2/CO reduction conditions or in cases where CO impurities enter electrodes, the catalyst may exist under a high coverage of coadsorbed CO. We present DFT calculations that suggest that coadsorbed CO during hydrogen evolution will weaken the binding strength between H and the catalyst surface. For metals on the right-hand side (too weak of hydrogen binding) this should lead to a suppression of the HER, as has been reported for metals such as Cu and Pt. However, for metals on the left-hand side of the volcano (too strong of hydrogen binding), this may actually enhance the kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction, although this effect will be countered by a decreased availability of sites for HER, which are blocked by CO. We performed experiments in Ar and CO2 environments of two representative metals that bind CO on the far right- and left-hand side of the volcano, namely, Cu and Mo (respectively). On Cu, we find that the CO2 environment suppresses HER, which is consistent with previous findings. However, on Mo we find that the CO2 environment enhances HER in the kinetically active region. This helps to explain the outstanding performance of copper in CO2 reduction and suggests that searches for high-selectivity CO2/CO reduction catalysts may benefit from focusing on the right-hand side of the HER volcano. This also suggests principles for assessing the activity of catalysts for fuel cell and electrolysis reactions in which impurities such as CO may be present.",

These action units then form the building blocks to model complex human activities as sentences using an action grammar. To evaluate our approach, we collected a large dataset of daily cooking activities: The dataset includes a total of 52 participants, each performing a total of 10 cooking activities in multiple real-life kitchens, resulting in over 77 hours of video footage. We evaluate the HTK toolkit, a state-of-the-art speech recognition engine, in combination with multiple video feature descriptors, for both the recognition of cooking activities (e.g., making pancakes) as well as the semantic parsing of videos into action units (e.g., cracking eggs).

They play important roles in ocean ecosystems, and are among the most abundant gelatinous predators. A previous phylogenetic study based on two ribosomal RNA genes provided insight into the internal relationships between major siphonophore groups. There was, however, little support for many deep relationships within the clade Codonophora. Here, we present a new siphonophore phylogeny based on new transcriptome data from 29 siphonophore species analyzed in combination with 14 publicly available genomic and transcriptomic datasets. We use this new phylogeny to reconstruct several traits that are central to siphonophore biology, including sexual system (monoecy vs. dioecy), gain and loss of zooid types, life history traits, and habitat. The phylogenetic relationships in this study are largely consistent with the previous phylogeny, but we find strong support for new clades within Codonophora that were previously unresolved. These results have important implications for trait evolution within Siphonophora, including favoring the hypothesis that monoecy arose at least twice.",

In this study, we investigate the thermodynamics of PtTi, a novel and promising SMA (and of the related better-known NiTi SMA, for comparison purposes) using recently developed first-principles computational method specifically designed to tackle this issue. The method efficiently explores the system's potential energy surface by discrete sampling of local minima, combined with a continuous sampling of the vicinity of these local minima via a constrained harmonic lattice dynamic approach. Our calculations provide a complete and atomic-level-based model for these compounds' free energy and shed some light on the ongoing search for the precise structure of dynamically stabilized high temperature phases in SMAs.",

T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR imaging was conducted to investigate cross-sectional group differences with age between typically developing controls (N = 26) and youths diagnosed with bipolar disorder (N = 26). Region-based analysis was used to examine cortical thickness of gray matter and diffusion tensor parameters in superficial white matter, and tractography-based analysis was used to examine deep white matter fiber bundles. Patients and controls showed significantly different maturation trajectories across brain areas; however, the magnitude of differences varied by region. The rate of cortical thinning with age was greater in patients than controls in the left frontal pole. While controls showed increasing fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD) with age, patients showed an opposite trend of decreasing FA and AD with age in fronto-temporal-striatal regions located in both superficial and deep white matter. The findings support fronto-temporal-striatal alterations in the developmental trajectories of youths diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and further, show the value of multimodal computational techniques in the assessment of neuropsychiatric disorders. These preliminary results warrant further investigation into longitudinal changes and the effects of treatment in the brain areas identified in this study.",

    "abstract": "Humans are remarkably adept at generalizing knowledge between experiences in a way that can be difficult for computers. Often, this entails generalizing constituent pieces of experiences that do not fully overlap, but nonetheless share useful similarities with, previously acquired knowledge. However, it is often unclear how knowledge gained in one context should generalize to another. Previous computational models and data suggest that rather than learning about each individual context, humans build latent abstract structures and learn to link these structures to arbitrary contexts, facilitating generalization. In these models, task structures that are more popular across contexts are more likely to be revisited in new contexts. However, these models can only re-use policies as a whole and are unable to transfer knowledge about the transition structure of the environment even if only the goal has changed (or vice-versa). This contrasts with ecological settings, where some aspects of task structure, such as the transition function, will be shared between context separately from other aspects, such as the reward function. Here, we develop a novel non-parametric Bayesian agent that forms independent latent clusters for transition and reward functions, affording separable transfer of their constituent parts across contexts. We show that the relative performance of this agent compared to an agent that jointly clusters reward and transition functions depends environmental task statistics: the mutual information between transition and reward functions and the stochasticity of the observations. We formalize our analysis through an information theoretic account of the priors, and propose a meta learning agent that dynamically arbitrates between strategies across task domains to optimize a statistical tradeoff.",

Women have a heightened susceptibility to the effects of early life stress (ELS) and are twice as likely as men to develop debilitating, stress-associated disorders later in life, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Until now, mouse models of depression have been largely unsuccessful at replicating the diverse symptomatology of this disease and the sex bias in vulnerability. From P4 to P11, a limited bedding model that leads to fragmented maternal care, was used to induce ELS. Early adolescent and young adult mice were tested on an array of assays to test for depressive-like behavior. This included our newly developed automated home cage behavioral recognition system, where the home cage behavior of ELS and control mice could be monitored over a continuous 5–10 day span. ELS females, but not males, exhibited depressive-like behaviors on traditional assays. These effects emerged during adolescence and became more severe in adulthood. Using the novel home cage video monitoring method, we identified robust and continuous markers of depressive-like pathology in ELS females that phenocopy many of the behavioral characteristics of depression in humans. ELS effects on home cage behavior were rapidly rescued by ketamine, a fast-acting antidepressant. Together, these findings highlight that limited bedding ELS (1) produces an early emerging, female-specific depressive phenotype that responds to a fast-acting antidepressant and (2) this model has the potential to inform sex-selective risk for the development of stress-induced mental illness.",

    "abstract": "Advances in two-photon calcium (Ca 2+ ) imaging technologies are rapidly increasing the fidelity and scale of in-vivo neural recordings from behaving animals. These methodologies hold great promises for uncovering the neural computations that support behavior. One remaining challenge is the need to estimate the timing of action potentials (APs) from measured cellular Ca 2+ traces revealed by genetically encoded calcium indicators. Current approaches rely on manually pre-processing Ca 2+ imaging data, with routines for cell segmentation and signal normalization preceding deconvolution. Here, we show that by leveraging recent advances in recurrent neural networks it is possible to learn to detect APs end-to-end directly from raw Ca 2+ recordings. Our novel model achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. We further demonstrate that the relative success of the approach is based in part on the system's ability to learn spatio-temporal features that are typically associated with biophysical events known to contribute to the AP process.",

    "abstract": "The nature of capacity limits for visual working memory has been the subject of an intense debate that has relied on models that assume items are encoded independently. Here we propose that instead, similar features are jointly encoded through a “chunking” process to optimize performance on visual working memory tasks. We show that such chunking can: (a) facilitate performance improvements for abstract capacity-limited systems, (b) be optimized through reinforcement, (c) be implemented by center-surround dynamics, and (d) increase effective storage capacity at the expense of recall precision. Human performance on a variant of a canonical working memory task demonstrated performance advantages, precision detriments, interitem dependencies, and trial-to-trial behavioral adjustments diagnostic of performance optimization through center-surround chunking. Models incorporating center-surround chunking provided a better quantitative description of human performance in our study as well as in a meta-analytic dataset, and apparent differences in working memory capacity across individuals were attributable to individual differences in the implementation of chunking. Our results reveal a normative rationale for center-surround connectivity in working memory circuitry, call for reevaluation of memory performance differences that have previously been attributed to differences in capacity, and support a more nuanced view of visual working memory capacity limitations: strategic tradeoff between storage capacity and memory precision through chunking contribute to flexible capacity limitations that include both discrete and continuous aspects.",

Understanding how TDP-43 contributes to neurodegeneration will help direct therapeutic efforts. Here we have created a TDP-43 knock-in mouse with a human-equivalent mutation in the endogenous mouse Tardbp gene. TDP-43Q331K mice demonstrate cognitive dysfunction and a paucity of parvalbumin interneurons. Critically, TDP-43 autoregulation is perturbed, leading to a gain of TDP-43 function and altered splicing of Mapt, another pivotal dementia-associated gene. Furthermore, a new approach to stratify transcriptomic data by phenotype in differentially affected mutant mice revealed 471 changes linked with improved behavior. These changes included downregulation of two known modifiers of neurodegeneration, Atxn2 and Arid4a, and upregulation of myelination and translation genes. With one base change in murine Tardbp, this study identifies TDP-43 misregulation as a pathogenic mechanism that may underpin ALS-FTD and exploits phenotypic heterogeneity to yield candidate suppressors of neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Point process generalized linear models (PP-GLMs) provide an important statistical framework for modeling spiking activity in single-neurons and neuronal networks. Stochastic stability is essential when sampling from these models, as done in computational neuroscience to analyze statistical properties of neuronal dynamics and in neuro-engineering to implement closed-loop applications. Here we show, however, that despite passing common goodness-of-fit tests, PP-GLMs estimated from data are often unstable, leading to divergent firing rates. The inclusion of absolute refractory periods is not a satisfactory solution since the activity then typically settles into unphysiological rates. To address these issues, we derive a framework for determining the existence and stability of fixed points of the expected conditional intensity function (CIF) for general PP-GLMs. Specifically, in nonlinear Hawkes PP-GLMs, the CIF is expressed as a function of the previous spike history and exogenous inputs. We use a mean-field quasi-renewal (QR) approximation that decomposes spike history effects into the contribution of the last spike and an average of the CIF over all spike histories prior to the last spike. Fixed points for stationary rates are derived as self-consistent solutions of integral equations. Bifurcation analysis and the number of fixed points predict that the original models can show stable, divergent, and metastable (fragile) dynamics. For fragile models, fluctuations of the single-neuron dynamics predict expected divergence times after which rates approach unphysiologically high values. This metric can be used to estimate the probability of rates to remain physiological for given time periods, e.g., for simulation purposes. We demonstrate the use of the stability framework using simulated single-neuron examples and neurophysiological recordings. Finally, we show how to adapt PP-GLM estimation procedures to guarantee model stability. Overall, our results provide a stability framework for data-driven PP-GLMs and shed new light on the stochastic dynamics of state-of-the-art statistical models of neuronal spiking activity.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability in the United States. Time to treatment is often related to patient outcome. Access to cerebral imaging data in a timely manner is a vital component of patient care. Current methods of detecting and quantifying intracranial pathology can be time-consuming and require careful review of 2D/3D patient images by a radiologist. Additional time is needed for image protocoling, acquisition, and processing. These steps often occur in series, adding more time to the process and potentially delaying time-dependent management decisions for patients with traumatic brain injury.\nOur team adapted machine learning and computer vision methods to develop a technique that rapidly and automatically detects CT-identifiable lesions. Specifically, we use scale invariant feature transform (SIFT)1 and deep convolutional neural networks (CNN)2 to identify important image features that can distinguish TBI lesions from background data. Our learning algorithm is a linear support vector machine (SVM)3. Further, we also employ tools from topological data analysis (TDA) for gleaning insights into the correlation patterns between healthy and pathological data. The technique was validated using 409 CT scans of the brain, acquired via the Progesterone for the Treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury phase III clinical trial (ProTECT_III) which studied patients with moderate to severe TBI4. CT data were annotated by a central radiologist and included patients with positive and negative scans. Additionally, the largest lesion on each positive scan was manually segmented. We reserved 80% of the data for training the SVM and used the remaining 20% for testing. Preliminary results are promising with 92.55% prediction accuracy (sensitivity = 91.15%, specificity = 93.45%), indicating the potential usefulness of this technique in clinical scenarios.",

Such technologies enable long-term, continuous interrogation of neural circuits and importantly open the door for chronic neurorehabilitation platforms. For example, by providing continuous consistent closed loop feedback from a brain machine interface, the nervous system can leverage plasticity to integrate more effectively into the system than would be possible in short experimental sessions. However, to fully realize this opportunity necessitates the development of experimental environments that do not hinder wireless data transmission. Traditional nonhuman primate metal cage construction, while durable and standardized around the world, prevents data transmission at the frequencies necessary for high-bandwidth data transfer.\n\nNew method\nTo overcome this limitation, we have engineered and constructed a radio-frequency transparent home environment for nonhuman primates using primarily non-conductive materials.\n\nResults\nComputational modeling and empirical testing were performed to demonstrate the behavior of transmitted signals passing through the enclosure. In addition, neural data were successfully recorded from a freely behaving nonhuman primate inside the housing system.\n\nComparison with existing methods\nOur design outperforms standard metallic home cages by allowing radiation to transmit beyond its boundaries, without significant interference, while simultaneously maintaining the mechanical and operational integrity of existing commercial home cages.\n\nConclusions\nContinuous access to neural signals in combination with other bio-potential and kinematic sensors will empower new insights into unrestrained behavior, aid the development of advanced neural prostheses, and enable neurorehabilitation strategies to be employed outside traditional environments.",

Here, we demonstrate that these low-dimensional dynamics, revealed by unsupervised latent state-space models, can provide as accurate or better reconstruction of movement kinematics as direct decoding from the entire recorded ensemble. Ensembles of single neurons were recorded with triple microelectrode arrays (MEAs) implanted in ventral and dorsal premotor (PMv, PMd) and primary motor (M1) cortices while nonhuman primates performed 3-D reach-to-grasp actions. Low-dimensional dynamics were estimated via various types of latent state-space models including, for example, Poisson linear dynamic system (PLDS) models. Decoding from low-dimensional dynamics was implemented via point process and Kalman filters coupled in series. We also examined decoding based on a predictive subsampling of the recorded population. In this case, a supervised greedy procedure selected neuronal subsets that optimized decoding performance. When comparing decoding based on predictive subsampling and latent state-space models, the size of the neuronal subset was set to the same number of latent state dimensions. Overall, our findings suggest that information about naturalistic reach kinematics present in the recorded population is preserved in the inferred low-dimensional motor cortex dynamics. Furthermore, decoding based on unsupervised PLDS models may also outperform previous approaches based on direct decoding from the recorded population or on predictive subsampling.",

Once a seizure is predicted/detected by the system, electrical stimulation is delivered to prevent seizure initiation or spread. So far, seizure prediction/detection has been limited to tracking non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) or intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals. Here, we examine seizure prediction based on local field potentials (LFPs) from a small neocortical patch recorded via a 10×10 microelectrode array implanted in a patient with focal seizures. We formulate the seizure (ictal) prediction problem in terms of discriminating between interictal and preictal neural activity. Using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we show that periods of preictal activity can be successfully discriminated (80% detection; no false positives) from periods of interictal activity several (2-18) minutes prior to seizure onset. CNN input features consisted of the spectral power of LFP channels (1-second time windows) computed in 50 frequency bands (0-100 Hz; 2 Hz steps). Our preliminary results show that intracortical LFPs may be a promising neural signal for seizure prediction in focal epilepsy.",

Learning from feedback thus informs us not only about the value of stimulus-action associations but also about which rule set applies. Hierarchical clustering models suggest that learners discover structure in the environment, clustering distinct sensory events into a single latent rule set. Such structure enables a learner to transfer any newly acquired information to other contexts linked to the same rule set, and facilitates re-use of learned knowledge in novel contexts. Here, we show that humans exhibit this transfer, generalization and clustering during learning. Trial-by-trial model-based analysis of EEG signals revealed that subjects’ reward expectations incorporated this hierarchical structure; these structured neural signals were predictive of behavioral transfer and clustering. These results further our understanding of how humans learn and generalize flexibly by building abstract, behaviorally relevant representations of the complex, high-dimensional sensory environment.",

    "abstract": "The field of multiple view geometry has seen tremendous progress in reconstruction and calibration due to methods for extracting reliable point features and key developments in projective geometry. Point features, however, are not available in certain applications and result in unstructured point cloud reconstructions. General image curves provide a complementary feature when keypoints are scarce, and result in 3D curve geometry, but face challenges not addressed by the usual projective geometry of points and algebraic curves. We address these challenges by laying the theoretical foundations of a framework based on the differential geometry of general curves, including stationary curves, occluding contours, and non-rigid curves, aiming at stereo correspondence, camera estimation (including calibration, pose, and multiview epipolar geometry), and 3D reconstruction given measured image curves. By gathering previous results into a cohesive theory, novel results were made possible, yielding three contributions. First, we derive the differential geometry of an image curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative) from that of the underlying space curve (tangent, curvature, curvature derivative, torsion). Second, we derive the differential geometry of a space curve from that of two corresponding image curves. Third, the differential motion of an image curve is derived from camera motion and the differential geometry and motion of the space curve. The availability of such a theory enables novel curve-based multiview reconstruction and camera estimation systems to augment existing point-based approaches. This theory has been used to reconstruct a “3D curve sketch”, to determine camera pose from local curve geometry, and tracking; other developments are underway.",

When these conditions are not met, model-based results can be misleading or biased.

Further, the impact of the threonine variant on cognitive function remains unknown. The present study utilized multiple indices of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and neuropsychological assessment to examine the integrity of specific white matter tracts and cognition between individuals with homozygous genotypes of M268T (MetMet n = 27, ThrThr n = 27). Differences in subcortical hyperintensity (SH) volume were also examined between groups. Results indicated that the threonine variant was associated with significantly reduced integrity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and the cingulate gyrus segment of the cingulum bundle (cingulum CG) compared to those with the methionine variant, and poorer cognitive performance on tests of attention/processing speed and language. Despite these associations, integrity of these tracts did not significantly mediate relationships between cognition and genetic status, and SH did not differ significantly between groups. Collectively our results suggest that the threonine variant of M268T is a significant risk factor for abnormalities in specific white matter tracts and cognitive domains in healthy older adults, independent of SH burden.",

    "abstract": "This review presents a perspective on capturing collective dynamics in recorded neuronal ensembles based on multivariate point process models, inference of low-dimensional dynamics and coarse graining of spatiotemporal measurements. A general probabilistic framework for continuous time point processes reviewed, with an emphasis on multivariate nonlinear Hawkes processes with exogenous inputs. A point process generalized linear model (PP-GLM) framework for the estimation of discrete time multivariate nonlinear Hawkes processes is described. The approach is illustrated with the modeling of collective dynamics in neocortical neuronal ensembles recorded in human and non-human primates, and prediction of single-neuron spiking. A complementary approach to capture collective dynamics based on low-dimensional dynamics (“order parameters”) inferred via latent state-space models with point process observations is presented. The approach is illustrated by inferring and decoding low-dimensional dynamics in primate motor cortex during naturalistic reach and grasp movements. Finally, we briefly review hypothesis tests based on conditional inference and spatiotemporal coarse graining for assessing collective dynamics in recorded neuronal ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Huntington’s disease (HD) is genetically determined but with variability in symptom onset, leading to uncertainty as to when pharmacological intervention should be initiated. Here we take a computational approach based on neurocognitive phenotyping, computational modeling, and classification, in an effort to provide quantitative predictors of HD before symptom onset. A large sample of subjects—consisting of both pre-manifest individuals carrying the HD mutation (pre-HD), and early symptomatic—as well as healthy controls performed the antisaccade conflict task, which requires executive control and response inhibition. While symptomatic HD subjects differed substantially from controls in behavioral measures [reaction time (RT) and error rates], there was no such clear behavioral differences in pre-HD. RT distributions and error rates were fit with an accumulator-based model which summarizes the computational processes involved and which are related to identified mechanisms in more detailed neural models of prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Classification based on fitted model parameters revealed a key parameter related to executive control differentiated pre-HD from controls, whereas the response inhibition parameter declined only after symptom onset. These findings demonstrate the utility of computational approaches for classification and prediction of brain disorders, and provide clues as to the underlying neural mechanisms.",

In everyday life, such task sequences are abstract in that they do not require consistent movement sequences and are often assembled “on the fly.” Yet, remarkably little is known about the necessity of frontal sub-regions for such control. Participants repeatedly completed sequences of simple tasks during fMRI scanning. Rostrolateral prefrontal cortex (RLPFC) activation ramped over sequence position and reset at the initiation of each new sequence. To establish the necessity and function of RLPFC in this task, participants performed the sequential task while undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the RLPFC versus two prefrontal control regions. Across two independent experiments, only RLPFC stimulation increasingly disrupted task performance as each sequence progressed. These data establish RLPFC as necessary for uncertainty resolution during sequence-level control.",

    "abstract": "Extraversion is a fascinating personality dimension that consists of two major components, agentic extraversion and affiliative extraversion. Agentic extraversion involves incentive motivation and is expressed as a tendency toward assertiveness, persistence, and achievement. Affiliative extraversion involves the positive emotion of social warmth and is expressed as a tendency toward amicability, gregariousness, and affection. Here we investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of the personality traits of agentic and affiliative extraversion using the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form, structural magnetic resonance imaging, and voxel-based morphometry in a sample of 83 healthy adult volunteers. We found that trait agentic extraversion and trait affiliative extraversion were each positively associated with the volume of the medial orbitofrontal cortex bilaterally (t’s ≥ 2.03, r’s ≥ .23, p’s < .05). Agentic extraversion was specifically and positively related to the volume of the left parahippocampal gyrus (t = 4.08, r = .21, p < .05), left cingulate gyrus (t = 4.75, r = .28, p < .05), left caudate (t = 4.29, r = .24, p < .05), and left precentral gyrus (t = 4.00, r = .18, p < .05) in males and females, and the volume of the right nucleus accumbens in males (t = 2.92, r = .20, p < .05). Trait affiliative extraversion was not found to be associated with additional regions beyond the medial orbitofrontal cortex. The findings provide the first evidence of a neuroanatomical dissociation between the personality traits of agentic and affiliative extraversion in healthy adults.",

We analyze an adaptive procedure based on cross validation, and establish its convergence rate under the Frobenius norm. The convergence rates under other matrix norms are also established. This method also enjoys the advantage of fast computation for large-scale problems, via a coordinate descent algorithm. Numerical merits are illustrated using both simulated and real datasets.

    "abstract": "Understanding the sources of variability in single-neuron spiking responses is an important open problem for the theory of neural coding. This variability is thought to result primarily from spontaneous collective dynamics in neuronal networks. Here, we investigate how well collective dynamics reflected in motor cortex local field potentials (LFPs) can account for spiking variability during motor behavior. Neural activity was recorded via microelectrode arrays implanted in ventral and dorsal premotor and primary motor cortices of non-human primates performing naturalistic 3-D reaching and grasping actions. Point process models were used to quantify how well LFP features accounted for spiking variability not explained by the measured 3-D reach and grasp kinematics. LFP features included the instantaneous magnitude, phase and analytic-signal components of narrow band-pass filtered (δ,θ,α,β) LFPs, and analytic signal and amplitude envelope features in higher-frequency bands. Multiband LFP features predicted single-neuron spiking (1ms resolution) with substantial accuracy as assessed via ROC analysis. Notably, however, models including both LFP and kinematics features displayed marginal improvement over kinematics-only models. Furthermore, the small predictive information added by LFP features to kinematic models was redundant to information available in fast-timescale (<100 ms) spiking history. Overall, information in multiband LFP features, although predictive of single-neuron spiking during movement execution, was redundant to information available in movement parameters and spiking history. Our findings suggest that, during movement execution, collective dynamics reflected in motor cortex LFPs primarily relate to sensorimotor processes directly controlling movement output, adding little explanatory power to variability not accounted by movement parameters.",

Despite these identified relationships, the impact of I405V on gray matter microstructure remains unknown. The present study examined the impact of the CETP I405V polymorphism on gray matter integrity among 52 healthy adults between ages 51 and 85. Gray matter was measured bilaterally using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Participants were grouped according to a dominant statistical model (II genotype vs. IV/VV genotypes) and secondary analyses were completed to examine the interactive effects of CETP and ApoE4 on DTI metrics. Compared to individuals with the IV/VV genotypes, II homozygotes demonstrated significantly higher MD in bilateral temporal, parietal, and occipital gray matter. Secondary analyses revealed higher FA and AD in the left temporal lobe of IV/VV genotypes with an ApoE4 allele. Our results provide preliminary evidence that CETP II homozygosity is a predisposing risk factor for gray matter abnormalities in posterior brain regions in healthy older adults, independent of an ApoE4 allele.",

    "abstract": "Some of the most clinically consequential aspects of focal epilepsy, e.g. loss of consciousness, arise from the generalization or propagation of seizures through local and large-scale neocortical networks. Yet, the dynamics of such neocortical propagation remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the microdynamics of focal seizure propagation in neocortical patches (4 × 4 mm) recorded via high-density microelectrode arrays (MEAs) implanted in people with pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. Our main findings are threefold: (1) a newly developed stage segmentation method, applied to local field potentials (LFPs) and multiunit activity (MUA), revealed a succession of discrete seizure stages, each lasting several seconds. These different stages showed characteristic evolutions in overall activity and spatial patterns, which were relatively consistent across seizures within each of the 5 patients studied. Interestingly, segmented seizure stages based on LFPs or MUA showed a dissociation of their spatiotemporal dynamics, likely reflecting different contributions of non-local synaptic inputs and local network activity. (2) As previously reported, some of the seizures showed a peak in MUA that happened several seconds after local seizure onset and slowly propagated across the MEA. However, other seizures had a more complex structure characterized by, for example, several MUA peaks, more consistent with the succession of discrete stages than the slow propagation of a simple wavefront of increased MUA. In both cases, nevertheless, seizures characterized by spike-wave discharges (SWDs, ~ 2–3 Hz) eventually evolved into patterns of phase-locked MUA and LFPs. (3) Individual SWDs or gamma oscillation cycles (25–60 Hz), characteristic of two different types of recorded seizures, tended to propagate with varying degrees of directionality, directions of propagation and speeds, depending on the identified seizure stage. However, no clear relationship was observed between the MUA peak onset time (in seizures where such peak onset occurred) and changes in MUA or LFP propagation patterns. Overall, our findings indicate that the recruitment of neocortical territories into ictal activity undergoes complex spatiotemporal dynamics evolving in slow discrete states, which are consistent across seizures within each patient. Furthermore, ictal states at finer spatiotemporal scales (individual SWDs or gamma oscillations) are organized by slower time scale network dynamics evolving through these discrete stages.",

A second state-space model representation is then used to decode kinematics, via a Kalman filter, from the estimated low-dimensional dynamics. The latent SSM-based decoding approach is illustrated on neuronal activity recorded from primary motor cortex in a monkey performing naturalistic 3-D reach and grasp movements.

This is certainly difficult: it would require a clear mapping between observable indicators and unobservable cognitive states. In this report, we demonstrate how this is possible by monitoring eye gaze and pupil dilation, which predict dissociable biases during decision making. We quantified decision making using the drift diffusion model (DDM), which provides an algorithmic account of how evidence accumulation and response caution contribute to decisions through separate latent parameters of drift rate and decision threshold, respectively. We used a hierarchical Bayesian estimation approach to assess the single trial influence of observable physiological signals on these latent DDM parameters. Increased eye gaze dwell time specifically predicted an increased drift rate toward the fixated option, irrespective of the value of the option. In contrast, greater pupil dilation specifically predicted an increase in decision threshold during difficult decisions. These findings suggest that eye tracking and pupillometry reflect the operations of dissociated latent decision processes.",

    "abstract": "We propose a multi-stage approach to curve extraction where the curve fragment search space is iteratively reduced by removing unlikely candidates using geometric constrains, but without affecting recall, to a point where the application of an objective functional becomes appropriate. The motivation in using multiple stages is to avoid the drawback of using a global functional directly on edges, which can result in non-salient but high scoring curve fragments, which arise from non-uniformly distributed edge evidence. The process progresses in stages from local to global: (i) edges, (ii) curvelets, (iii) unambiguous curve fragments, (iv) resolving ambiguities to generate a full set of curve fragment candidates, (v) merging curve fragments based on a learned photometric and geometric cues as well a novel lateral edge sparsity cue, and (vi) the application of a learned objective functional to get a final selection of curve fragments. The resulting curve fragments are typically visually salient and have been evaluated in two ways. First, we measure the stability of curve fragments when images undergo visual transformations such as change in viewpoints, illumination, and noise, a critical factor for curve fragments to be useful to later visual processes but one often ignored in evaluation. Second, we use a more traditional comparison against human annotation, but using the CFGD dataset and CFGD evaluation strategy rather than the standard BSDS counterpart, which is shown to be not appropriate for evaluating curve fragments. Under both evaluation schemes our results are significantly better than those state of the art algorithms whose implementations are publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 50 million people in the world suffer from epileptic seizures. Reliable early seizure detection could bring significantly beneficial therapeutic alternatives. In recent decades, most approaches have relied on scalp EEG and intracranial EEG signals, but practical early detection for closed-loop seizure control remains challenging. In this study, we present preliminary analyses of an early detection approach based on intracortical neuronal multiunit activity (MUA) recorded from a 96-microelectrode array (MEA). The approach consists of (1) MUA detection from broadband field potentials recorded at 30 kHz by the MEA; (2) MUA feature extraction; (3) cost-sensitive support vector machine classification of ictal and interictal samples; and (4) Kalman-filtering postprocessing. MUA was here defined as the number of threshold crossing (spike counts) applied to the 300 Hz-6 kHz bandpass filtered local field potentials in 0.1 sec time windows. MUA features explored in this study included the mean, variance, and Fano-factor, computed across the MEA channels. In addition, we used the leading eigenvalues of MUA spatial and temporal correlation matrices computed in 1-sec moving time windows. We assessed the seizure detection approach on out-of-sample data from one-participant recordings with six seizure events and 4.73-hour interictal data. The proposed MUA-based detection approach yielded a 100% sensitivity (6/6) and no false positives, and a latency of 4.17 ± 2.27 sec (mean ± SD) with respect to ECoG-identified seizure onsets. These preliminary results indicate intracortical MUA may be a useful signal for early detection of human epileptic seizures.",

    "abstract": "Seizures are classically characterized as the expression of hypersynchronous neural activity, yet the true degree of synchrony in neuronal spiking (action potentials) during human seizures remains a fundamental question. We quantified the temporal precision of spike synchrony in ensembles of neocortical neurons during seizures in people with pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. Two seizure types were analyzed: those characterized by sustained gamma (∼40–60 Hz) local field potential (LFP) oscillations or by spike-wave complexes (SWCs; ∼3 Hz). Fine (<10 ms) temporal synchrony was rarely present during gamma-band seizures, where neuronal spiking remained highly irregular and asynchronous. In SWC seizures, phase locking of neuronal spiking to the SWC spike phase induced synchrony at a coarse 50–100 ms level. In addition, transient fine synchrony occurred primarily during the initial ∼20 ms period of the SWC spike phase and varied across subjects and seizures. Sporadic coherence events between neuronal population spike counts and LFPs were observed during SWC seizures in high (∼80 Hz) gamma-band and during high-frequency oscillations (∼130 Hz). Maximum entropy models of the joint neuronal spiking probability, constrained only on single neurons' nonstationary coarse spiking rates and local network activation, explained most of the fine synchrony in both seizure types. Our findings indicate that fine neuronal ensemble synchrony occurs mostly during SWC, not gamma-band, seizures, and primarily during the initial phase of SWC spikes. Furthermore, these fine synchrony events result mostly from transient increases in overall neuronal network spiking rates, rather than changes in precise spiking correlations between specific pairs of neurons.",

Here, we use transcriptome data from 15 newly-sequenced species in combination with 26 publicly available genomes and transcriptomes to assess phylogenetic relationships among major cnidarian lineages. Phylogenetic analyses using different partition schemes and models of molecular evolution, as well as topology tests for alternative phylogenetic relationships, support the monophyly of Medusozoa, Anthozoa, Octocorallia, Hydrozoa, and a clade consisting of Staurozoa, Cubozoa, and Scyphozoa. Support for the monophyly of Hexacorallia is weak due to the equivocal position of Ceriantharia. Taken together, these results further resolve deep cnidarian relationships, largely support traditional phylogenetic views on relationships, and provide a historical framework for studying the evolutionary processes involved in one of the most ancient animal radiations.",

    "abstract": "Standards-based data management facilitates data preservation, discoverability, and access for effective data reuse within research groups and across communities of researchers. Data sharing requires community consensus on standards for data management, such as storage and formats for digital data preservation, metadata (i.e., contextual data about the data) that should be recorded and stored, and data access. Video imaging is a valuable tool for measuring time-varying phenotypes in organismal biology, with particular application for research in functional morphology, comparative biomechanics, and animal behavior. The raw data are the videos, but videos alone are not sufficient for scientific analysis. Nearly endless videos of animals can be found on YouTube and elsewhere on the web, but these videos have little value for scientific analysis because essential metadata such as true frame rate, spatial calibration, genus and species, weight, age, etc. of organisms, are generally unknown. We have embarked on a project to build community consensus on video data management and metadata standards for organismal biology research. We collected input from colleagues at early stages, organized an open workshop, “Establishing Standards for Video Data Management,” at the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology meeting in January 2017, and then collected two more rounds of input on revised versions of the standards. The result we present here is a rubric consisting of nine standards for video data management, with three levels within each standard: good, better, and best practices. The nine standards are: (1) data storage; (2) video file formats; (3) metadata linkage; (4) video data and metadata access; (5) contact information and acceptable use; (6) camera settings; (7) organism(s); (8) recording conditions; and (9) subject matter/topic. The first four standards address data preservation and interoperability for sharing, whereas standards 5–9 establish minimum metadata standards for organismal biology video, and suggest additional metadata that may be useful for some studies. This rubric was developed with substantial input from researchers and students, but still should be viewed as a living document that should be further refined and updated as technology and research practices change. The audience for these standards includes researchers, journals, and granting agencies, and also the developers and curators of databases that may contribute to video data sharing efforts. We offer this project as an example of building community consensus for data management, preservation, and sharing standards, which may be useful for future efforts by the organismal biology research community.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new technique for the calibration of nuclear recoils in large noble element dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) used to search for WIMP dark matter in the local galactic halo. This technique provides a measurement of the low-energy nuclear recoil response of the target media using the measured scattering angle between multiple neutron interactions within the detector volume. Several strategies for improving this calibration technique are discussed, including the creation of a new type of quasi-monoenergetic 272 keV neutron source. We report results from a time-of-flight-based measurement of the neutron energy spectrum produced by an Adelphi Technology, Inc. DD108 neutron generator, confirming its suitability for the proposed calibration. The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a dual-phase liquid xenon TPC operating at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. Our proposed calibration technique for nuclear recoils in liquid xenon was performed in situ in the LUX detector using a collimated beam of mono-energetic 2.45 MeV neutrons produced by the DD108 fusion source. The nuclear recoil energy from the first neutron scatter in the TPC was reconstructed using the measured scattering angle defined by two-site neutron events within the active xenon volume. We measured the absolute charge (Qy) and light (Ly) yields at an average electric field of 180 V/cm for nuclear recoil energies spanning 0.7 to 74 keV and 1.1 to 74 keV, respectively. This calibration of the nuclear recoil signal yields will permit the further refinement of liquid xenon nuclear recoil signal models and clearly demonstrates measurable ionization and scintillation signals in this medium at recoil energies down to O(1 keV). The low-energy reach and reduced systematics of this calibration have particular significance for the low-mass WIMP sensitivity of several leading dark matter experiments.",

    "abstract": "The existence of non-baryonic cold dark matter is well established through a wealth of complementary observations such as the Cosmic Microwave Background, Supernova Type Ia and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. Despite the overwhelming cosmological evidence, the particle nature of dark matter remains unknown. The leading candidate is a Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP), a thermal relic from the Big Bang that only interacts through the gravitational and weak forces. A terrestrial detector with high target mass, low background levels and a low energy threshold (keV) should be able to record the rare, faint interactions between ordinary matter and galactic WIMP dark matter. The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a 370 kg liquid xenon time projection chamber that aims to detect WIMP recoils with xenon nuclei. The experiment is located a mile underground at the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota. LUX is poised to become the world's most sensitive dark matter detector after only 2 weeks of exposure and will surpass current detection limits by an order of magnitude after 300 days. The LUX experimental program consists of three phases: (1) the LUX0.1 prototype detector during 2007– 2009, (2) the commissioning and operation of the LUX detector at the Sanford surface laboratory during 2009–2012 and (3) the underground deployment and operation of the detector beginning in 2012. This thesis describes the first two phases of the LUX program. LUX utilizes 122 Hamamatsu R8778 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect photons produced by particle interactions in liquid xenon. The LUX PMT mounting, high voltage distribution, analog signal shaping and gain calibration system are described in detail. The PMTs are shown to have low radioactive background levels, single-photon sensitivity and a 30% photon detection efficiency at the 175 nm liquid xenon scintillation wavelength. Handling protocols and vacuum integrity control based on ion-initiated afterpulses are presented. Xenon purification and energy calibration results are described for LUX0.1. During the LUX surface run, light collection and statistical position resolution measurements were obtained. Additionally, the xenon circulation path was imaged with alpha particles from a Rn222 injection.",

    "abstract": "With the ongoing, exponential increase in ocean data from autonomous platforms, satellites, models, and in particular, the growing field of quantitative imaging, there arises a need for scalable and cost-efficient visualization tools to interpret these large volumes of data. With the recent proliferation of consumer grade head-mounted displays, the emerging field of virtual reality (VR) has demonstrated its benefit in numerous disciplines, ranging from medicine to archeology. However, these benefits have not received as much attention in the ocean sciences. Here, we summarize some of the ways that virtual reality has been applied to this field. We highlight a few examples in which we (the authors) demonstrate the utility of VR as a tool for ocean scientists. For oceanic datasets that are well-suited for three-dimensional visualization, virtual reality has the potential to enhance the practice of ocean science.",

    "abstract": "Differentiating epileptic seizures (ES) and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) is commonly based on electroencephalogram and concurrent video recordings (vEEG). Here, we demonstrate that these two types of seizures can be discriminated based on signals related to autonomic nervous system activity recorded via wearable sensors. We used Empatica E4 Wristband sensors worn on both arms in vEEG confirmed seizures, and machine learning methods to train classifiers, specifically, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Classification performance achieved a predictive accuracy of 78 ± 1.5% on previously unseen data for whether a seizure was epileptic or psychogenic, which is 6 standard deviations above the baseline of 68% accuracy. Our dataset contained altogether 35 seizures from 18 patients out of which 8 patients had 13 convulsive seizures. Prediction of seizure type was based on simple features derived from the segments of autonomic activity measurements (electrodermal activity, body temperature, blood volume pulse, and heart rate) and forearm acceleration. Features related to heart rate and electrodermal activity were ranked as the top predictors in XGBoost classifiers. We found that patients with PNES had a higher ictal heart rate and electrodermal activity than patients with ES. In contrast to existing published studies of mainly convulsive seizures, our classifier focuses on autonomic signals to differentiate convulsive or nonconvulsive semiology ES from PNES. Our results show that autonomic activity recorded via wearable sensors provides promising signals for detection and discrimination of psychogenic and epileptic seizures, but more work is necessary to improve the predictive power of the model.",

    "abstract": "Phthalic acid esters (phthalates) are male reproductive toxicants, which exert their most potent toxicity during fetal development. In the fetal rat, exposure to phthalates reduces testosterone biosynthesis, alters the development of seminiferous cords and other male reproductive tissues, and induces the formation of abnormal multinucleated germ cells (MNGs). Identification of MNGs is a time-intensive process, and it requires specialized training to identify MNGs in histological sections. As a result, MNGs are not routinely quantified in phthalate toxicity experiments. In order to speed up and standardize this process, we have developed an improved method for automated detection of MNGs. Using hand-labeled histological section images with human-identified MNGs, we trained a convolutional neural network with a U-Net architecture to identify MNGs on unlabeled images. With unseen hand-labeled images not used in model training, we assessed the performance of the model, using five different configurations of the data. On average, the model reached near human accuracy, and in the best model, it exceeded it. The use of automated image analysis will allow data on this histopathological endpoint to be more readily collected for analysis of phthalate toxicity. Our trained model application code is available for download at github.com/brown-ccv/mngcount.",

To track down these locations, we present the directoreadr code (github.com/brown-ccv/directoreadr). Using scans of Polk city directories from Providence, RI, directoreadr extracts and parses business location data with a high degree of accuracy. The image processing pipeline ran without any human input for 94.4% of the pages we examined. For the remaining 5.6%, we processed them with some human input. Through hand-checking a sample of three years, we estimate that ~94.6% of historical gas stations are correctly identified and located, with historical street changes and non-standard address formats being the main drivers of errors. As an example use, we look at gas stations, finding that gas stations were most common early in the study period in 1936, beginning a sharp and steady decline around 1950. We are making the dataset produced by directoreadr publicly available. We hope it will be used to explore a range of important questions about socioeconomic patterns in Providence and cities like it during the transformations of the mid-1900s.",

    "abstract": "Despite the growing availability of big data in many fields, historical data on socio-evironmental phenomena are often not available due to a lack of automated and scalable approaches for collecting, digitizing, and assembling them. We have developed a datamining method for extracting tabulated, geocoded data from printed directories. While scanning and optical character recognition (OCR) can digitize printed text, these methods alone do not capture the structure of the underlying data. Our pipeline integrates both page layout analysis and OCR to extract tabular, geocoded data from structured text. We demonstrate the utility of this method by applying it to scanned manufacturing registries from Rhode Island that record 41 years of industrial land use. The resulting spatio-temporal data can be used for socio-environmental analyses of industrialization at a resolution that was not previously possible. In particular, we find strong evidence for the dispersion of manufacturing from the urban core of Providence, the stateâ€™s capital, along the Interstate 95 corridor to the north and south.",

This scale captures cognitive, affective, behavioral, and motivational components of the construct that have been identified by various philosophers in their conceptual analyses of intellectual humility. We find that intellectual humility has four core dimensions: Open-mindedness (versus Arrogance), Intellectual Modesty (versus Vanity), Corrigibility (versus Fragility), and Engagement (versus Boredom). These dimensions display adequate self-informant agreement, and adequate convergent, divergent, and discriminant validity. In particular, Open-mindedness adds predictive power beyond the Big Six for an objective behavioral measure of intellectual humility, and Intellectual Modesty is uniquely related to Narcissism. We find that a similar factor structure emerges in Germanophone participants, giving initial evidence for the model’s cross-cultural generalizability.",

    "abstract": "The apparent unpredictability of epileptic seizures has a major impact in the quality of life of people with pharmacologically resistant seizures. Here, we present initial results and a proof-of-concept of how focal seizures can be predicted early in advance based on intracortical signals recorded from small neocortical patches away from identified seizure onset areas. We show that machine learning algorithms can discriminate between interictal and preictal periods based on multiunit activity (i.e. thresholded action potential counts) and multi-frequency band local field potentials recorded via 4 X 4 mm2 microelectrode arrays. Microelectrode arrays were implanted in 5 patients undergoing neuromonitoring for resective surgery. Post-implant analysis revealed arrays were outside the seizure onset areas. Preictal periods were defined as the 1-hour period leading to a seizure. A 5-minute gap between the preictal period and the putative seizure onset was enforced to account for potential errors in the determination of actual seizure onset times. We used extreme gradient boosting and long short-term memory networks for prediction. Prediction accuracy based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves reached 90% for at least one feature type in each patient. Importantly, successful prediction could be achieved based exclusively on multiunit activity. This result indicates that preictal activity in the recorded neocortical patches involved not only subthreshold postsynaptic potentials, perhaps driven by the distal seizure onset areas, but also neuronal spiking in distal recurrent neocortical networks. Beyond the commonly identified seizure onset areas, our findings point to the engagement of large-scale neuronal networks in the neural dynamics building up toward a seizure. Our initial results obtained on currently available human intracortical microelectrode array recordings warrant new studies on larger datasets, and open new perspectives for seizure prediction and control by emphasizing the contribution of multiscale neural signals in large-scale neuronal networks.",

Proteinarium converts user defined seed genes to protein symbols and maps them onto the STRING interactome. A PPI network is built for each sample using Dijkstra's algorithm. Pairwise similarity scores are calculated to compare the networks and cluster the samples. A layered graph of PPI networks for the samples in any cluster can be visualized. To test this newly developed analysis pipeline, we reanalyzed publicly available data sets, from which modest outcomes had previously been achieved. We found significant clusters of patients with unique genes which enhanced the findings in the original study.",
